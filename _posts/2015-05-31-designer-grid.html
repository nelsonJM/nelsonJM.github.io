<p>I was inspired by <a href="https://blog.intercom.io/how-to-hire-designers/">this Intercom blog post</a> to map my own knowledge and skills across the 4 layers of design (Outcome, System, Interaction, and Visual) mentioned in the post and originally defined <a href="https://blog.intercom.io/the-dribbblisation-of-design/">here</a>.</p>
