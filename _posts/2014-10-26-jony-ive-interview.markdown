My quick takeaways from [Jony Ive's interview with Vanity Fair](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/18/6999931/watch-jony-ive-explain-apples-design-process-in-a-rare-public).

"I feel so absurdly lucky to be part of a creative process. where on one day, on Tuesday At the beginning of the week, there is no idea. We don't know what we are going to do, there's nothing. Then, by Wednesday, there's an idea that was created. Invariably the idea is thought that becomes a conversation. The way we design to start with, is to talk. It's fairly exclusive, only involves a few people. A remarkbale thing happens in the process, and it's the point where there's the greatest change - it's when we give form to the abstract idea. The abstract idea is fairly exclusive, as soon as it's an object - this shift is profound. It galvanizes and provides a focus to the team. It won't become the final design but it describes what we're trying to do.

Jony talked about having an idea and "stubbornly" holding on to it and pushing it. This is a good thing - as long as you reach a point where you decide whether it's worth pursuing further or to let it go.

"'What if we did this?' 'No, that won't work'". You have to work with great people who won't just say that something will not work. "If you're working with great people, their intrigued, and very often it won't work but there's something else that does."

Jony also answered some questions from the crowd:

Question: My question focuses on the balance between the functionality of your products and the design. As you probably know, there's a large body of research that focuses on aesthetic perception of information technology artifacts and how if something is perceived as beautiful, that it's also perceived as having higher quality and inevitably, better usability. And this is actually something that a lot of technology companies struggle with, they might make a beautiful product, but it doesn't function well. And Apple seems to have succeeded at both, having that balance of a beautiful product but also great functionality, so I was wondering in comparison with other technology companies, how does Apple successfully strike that balance between functionality and design.

Answer: I think the way we see design, is it's everything. So I think a beautiful product that doesn't work very well, is ugly. So I can't really compartmentalize. The best things we've done are those that are completely harmonious and you couldn't compartmentalize. So i think design is the whole thing. And very often the beauty is in - that it works, and perhaps not in the appearance. 

Question: Do you have examples of things you thought were really great design, where those two factors [functionality and beauty] work together?

Answer: I believe we sense when there's been care taken in a product - just in the same way we sense carelessness. And sadly, most of our manufacture environments testify, I think, to carelessness. It testifies to "get it built fast", "make it cheap", "make it look different". One of the things we strive to do for humanity is to take care. You can make something as a craftsperson, without care and you can make something in mass production with incredible care - and vice-versa.
