excerpt: "From app idea to job-to-be-done to product design - this is a rough outline of how I currently see it all playing out."
---
<p>You have an idea for an app that you think a small number[1] of eager people will hire to do a particular job for them.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Instead of building it right away, make sure you know what job the product really does for your customers[2] and you can summarize the job. Interviewing[3] customers/potential customers is a huge part of this step and will yield a good deal of info. 
		<ul>
			<li>you'll learn about their past and current behavior,</li>
			<li>other products they've hired,</li>
			<li>the motivations and anxieties (forces[4])surrounding the purchase of those other products</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You should now have the job-what the solution you plan to build should accomplish. You can use it to:
		<ul>
			<li>guide marketing efforts</li>
			<li>guide design and development efforts</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Knowing the job your product is hired to do helps you prioritize features and make tradeoffs[5] in product design</h2>

<p>Your features are smaller jobs that support the main job and can be summarized in the form of a "job story"[6] (situation + motivation and forces = outcome)</p>
<ul>
	<li>each feature is composed of a broad job story, flows, screens, domain-specific language and a domain model</li>
	<li>each screen of your app can have several job stories that all support the larger feature job story</li>
	<li>the UI elements, domain language, and models that are on each screen must be arranged in a way that resolves the motivations/forces and anxieties[4][7] that are tied to each job on the screen</li>
</ul>

<p>4. Ryan Singer gave a talk called "Designing with Forces" (watch it at <a href="http://feltpresence.com/">http://feltpresence.com/</a> - scroll to bottom of page) which was based on Christopher Alexander's 'Notes on the Sythesis of Form'. That talk is awesome and in my opinion a must-watch for interface designers.</p>
