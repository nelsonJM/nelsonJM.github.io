    <h2>Problem Overview</h2>
    <p>When it's my turn to count the number of attendees in a meeting and I may be interrupted at any moment by an attendee, I want to be able to count and keep track of the current count at the same time, so that I have an accurate number to send to the record-keeper(s).</p>
   
    <h2>Problem Statement or The Reason This App Exists: A Situation</h2>
    <p>I count roughly 90-120 meeting attendees each month. I begin by looking around the room, counting heads and keeping track of the number in my mind. When I'm done, I write down the number or put it in a note taking app. If someone interrupts me while counting, I sometimes have to start over or ask them to wait.</p>
    <h3>How did the problem shift as I worked through the project?</h3>
    <p>As I worked through this project, I realized a few things. First, counting moving people from a distance is harder than counting seated people. Initially, I focused on <em>"If someone interrupts me while counting, I sometimes have to start over or ask them to wait."</em>(from the problem overview above) as the main pain point this app would resolve. In reality, I discovered that counting moving objects, like kids running around outside (or inside a classroom), was the main opportunity to add value and the need to remember the numbers was just par for the course.</p> 
    <p>The second thing I realized and I'm still learning about, is that there is a significant emotional side to the problem that I discovered during my initial research. I believe the design would have suffered without attention to the emotional aspect of the situation for which it was designed.</p>


<p>A Couple of Points Before I Begin:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I'm not an expert practitioner of the Jobs to Be Done approach to customer research and product design. I appreciate the importance that Jobs-to-Be-Done places on understanding what customer's are trying to accomplish in a given context and the tradeoffs they are willing to make to achieve their goals.</li>
  <li>I'm designing this for myself. There's a chance I may interview others, but for now I will be the primary research target.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Design Process Story</h2>
<h3>Research and Identifying the Job-to-be-Done</h3>



<p>I'l be using the <a href="http://jobstobedone.org/news/filling-in-leans-gaps/">Job Outline</a> to help in researching the problem and determining what the solution should accomplish. The goal of the outline is to identify the job that customers want done. Here are the four parts of the job outline:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Exposition</li>
    <li>Observation</li>
    <li>Situational Analysis</li>
    <li>Job-to-be-Done</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I use <a href="https://medium.com/the-job-to-be-done/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27">job stories</a> as a tool for summarizing the job and capturing key constraints, motivations and forces. The job story for the Counter app is:</p>  
  
  <div class="block">
    <span class="context-sig">The Job Story</span>
    <p><strong>"When it's my turn to count the number of attendees in the meeting and I may be interrupted at any moment by an attendee, I want to be able to count and keep track of the current count at the same time, so that I have an accurate number to send to the record-keeper(s)."</strong></p>
  </div>

<h3>Exposition - The Context of the Customer's Struggle</h3>
<p>Understanding the context helps me understand the problem I am solving.</p>
<p>Each month, myself and another person, whom I will call my 'co-usher', have the responsibility to count the number of people who meet together in an elementary school. This group of people can be divided into the following subgroups: attendees, childcare workers, and children. My co-usher and I split the counting so that one of us will count attendees and the other will count the childcare workers and children. After the meeting we combine our counts and one of us will send the totals to a designated record-keeper who oversees the meeting attendance.</p>

<h3>Observation</h3>
<p>Observing how the problem has been solved in the past and how it is currently being solved provides me with real behavior I can question and analyze.</p>
<p>My goal is to observe how I currently solve the problem, discover the products I have used in the past and that I'm currently using to solve the problem, and learn more about the context of the struggle.</p>
<p>Since I'm designing this app for myself, I conducted my observation using a combination of recall and "on-the-job" note-taking, meaning I recorded some of my actions, thoughts and observations while performing the counting task.</p> 
<p>Now is a good time to mention that counting is only one of my responsibilities. I have listed my additional responsibilities below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>co-usher and I need to arrive at the elementary school by 9:45 a.m and set up chairs for the attendees in the cafeteria.</li>
  <li>Set up signs that indicate where the restrooms and the nursing mothers room are located.</li>
  <li>Place the children's crafts and supplies in the designated classroom.</li>
  <li>Greet people as they arrive.</li>
  <li>Pass out meeting material to those who need it.</li>
  <li>Help attendees find seating as they arrive</li>
  <li>Count the attendees, childcare workers and children.</li>
  <li>Text count to record-keeper</li>
  <li>Pass out announcements at close of meeting</li>
  <li>"Break down" chair set up and place chairs on designated carts</li>
  <li>Put away all signs</li>
  <li>Leave meeting areas in order we found them.</li>
</ul>

<h4>My Observations - What, Where, When, and Why</h4>
<p>Below are some of my observations of my behavior before, during, and after performing the activity of counting attendees. I decided to first present the observed behavior (the 'What', 'Where', 'When') followed by questions related to the observation, that I asked myself in order to investigate the 'why' or causality behind my behavior as well as my answers.</p>
<strong>Arrive at the School</strong>
<p>I arrive at the school around 9:45 a.m., park in the school lot, enter the school and head straight to the cafeteria where the main meeting will take place.</p>

<strong>Chair Setup</strong>
<p>There are 3-4 carts filled with stacked or folded chairs that are waiting either in the cafeteria or the hallway. If necessary, my co-usher and I move the carts of chairs from the hallway into the cafeteria. We unload the chairs and form rows arranged in a square. The first row is shortest, 4 chairs, then the next is 7 chairs, then 10, and so on. When all the chairs are arranged and straightened, we push the carts out into the hallway.</p>

<strong>Setup Signs and Supplies</strong>
<p>Next, I or the co-usher, go to the janitor's office and get the restroom signs, nursing moms sign and children's supplies. Each item has a specific room or location in the building. </p>

<strong>Attendees Arrive</strong>
<p>Around 10:00am, people begin to trickle in. Some put things on the chairs but most stand near the snacks and coffee. Around 10:30am, the meeting begins and people walk to the chairs and begin looking for a seat.</p>

<strong>During the Meeting</strong>
<p>As the meeting progresses, more people arrive and sit on fold out tables if a chair is not open. Some leave their seat and return later.</p>

<strong>Counting</strong>
<p>Around 11:00 a.m., I create a new note using the Notability or Simplenote app, stand up, lean against the wall behind me and begin counting attendees who are sitting in chairs. I do this during a time when people are focused on someone at the opposite side of the room. I don't move my arms or hands much, just my lips as I count. When I have the number, I record it in my open note. Next, I'll count the people who chose to sit at the folding tables or elsewhere and add them to the numbers on my note. Meanwhile, my co-usher has left the cafeteria to count the number of childcare workers and children.</p>

<div class="block">
  <span class="context-sig">Understanding the 'Why' behind the behavior</span>
  <p><strong>Why do I stand up when the audience is not focused on my general direction?</strong> So that I am less noticeable. I don't like to draw attention to myself.</p>
  <p><strong>Do I do anything else while I'm counting?</strong> I hold my phone, put one hand in my pocket, or try in some way to look casual/comfortable and try to focus on counting.</p>
  <p><strong>How do I get a better look when I have trouble seeing?</strong> I walk towards the opposite corner or along the side of the room. I've also tried counting the number of empty chairs (since I know the number we initially set up). This helps speed up the counting.</p>
  <p><strong>Does that method of counting work for me?</strong> As long as the meeting is not too big, yes. If it is a large meeting (which is common), and we are periodically adding chairs or entire rows to accommodate people, then it is tough to keep track of the number of additional chairs.</p>
  <p><strong>What does the counting process look like when I count childcare workers and children?</strong> The workers and children are divided into 3 groups: toddlers, preschoolers, and older kids. The preschoolers and older kids meet in two classrooms. I will walk to each classroom, peek in, and count both the children and the workers. I do this in my head and as I am walking to the next group of people to count, I input the numbers in my Notability or Simplenote app.</p>
  <p><strong>What do I input - just numbers and a quick note?</strong> I type "workers", then the number of workers and "children", then the number of children. Sometimes I'll just type the numbers stacked with the number of workers on top and the children below since there are usually more children than workers and it's easy to distinguish which number corresponds to which group.</p>
  <p><strong>Which tools have I used in the past to record the counts?</strong> I've used Evernote, Simplenote, Notability, Apple's notes app, my memory, and pen and paper.</p>
  <p><strong>Is there one that I use more often?</strong> I move between Simplenote and Notability. Simplenote feels easier to open a new note and have it ready. Notability and especially Evernote have more UI chrome and feel like overload for a simple task. By 'overload', I mean that if I had scratch paper and a pencil, that's all I'd need, but I would look like I'm working too much. I want the paper and pencil simplicity but on the phone so I don't look like I'm working hard.</p>
  <p><strong>Why don't I want to look like I'm working hard?</strong> I want to do a good job but I also want the right perspective and appropriate behavior. The meeting is comfortable, familiar and has a somewhat casual atmosphere. I don't want to stick out like a rigid, "by the books" official taking a census.</p>
  <p><strong>So when it's time to count, I stand up, off to the side, open Simplenote and begin counting - do I input as I count or count first?</strong> I open Simplenote after I count or before. If I'm counting attendees in the main meeting, I usually count first, hold the number in memory, sit down or walk out, take out my phone and input the counts in Simplenote along with a label like "meeting". Something I noticed while counting children was that I cannot count and input the numbers at the same time, but I really wish I could. Instead, I have to count, open Simplenote or at least unlock my phone, tap the note to bring up the keyboard, type the number and sometimes the label, too. That seems like a lot of work.</p>

</div>

<strong>Sending the Counts</strong>
<p>When my co-usher returns, we exchange counts and one of us (usually the one who combines the counts) will send all three counts (attendees, childcare workers, and children) to someone who keeps track of meeting attendance.</p>
<div class="block">
  <span class="context-sig">Understanding the 'Why' behind the behavior</span>
  <p><strong>Who sends the count and who receives the count?</strong> It goes to one person who I'm calling the 'record-keeper'. I'm sure what that person does with it. In the past, we would write down the count on a piece of paper and place it in a folder. It's not a rule, but the person who counts the attendees in the meeting is usually the one who compiles the numbers and sends them to the record-keeper.</p>
  <p><strong>What's my process for sending the count?</strong> I send it as a text message. If I'm the one who counted the attendees, then I'll get the numbers from my co-usher and add them to my Simplenote 'note', like this:</p>
  <p>Meeting: 100</p>
  <p>Workers: 3</p>
  <p>Children: 10</p>

  <p>Then I'll 'long press' the note to bring up the context menu, press 'Select all', press 'Copy', then switch over to the messages app, create a new message addressed to the record-keeper, type something like 'Here's today's meeting count', paste the count into the message and send.</p>
</div>
<h3>Situational Analysis</h3>
My goal is to <a href="https://vimeo.com/10875362">design with forces</a> in mind. There are forces within the environment and situation surrounding my product that will impact the final design of the solution. There are also motivations within the customer that must be reconciled by the design. My aim is to balance or reconcile those forces and motivations using my domain knowledge and design patterns.</p>
<p>The job outline makes use of the <a href="http://jobstobedone.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-Shot-2012-10-29-at-7.16.58-PM.png">forces diagram</a> to perform the situational analysis. I like how the diagram breaks up the "forces" and motivations into 4 distinct areas, listed below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Push of the situation</li>
  <li>Magnetism of the new solution</li>
  <li>Habit of the present</li>
  <li>Anxiety of the new solution</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is that same list, only this time I added some of the forces and motivations that I discovered through my observations and questioning:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Push of the situation:
    <ul>
      <li>I want fewer steps to get the job done</li>
      <li>Too much typing is a pain</li>
      <li>Exchanging counts while the meeting is still going on is disruptive.</li>
      <li>I want to count and record my count at the same time, without having to switch my eyes back and forth from phone to people</li>
      <li>I don't want to look like I'm doing a lot of work</li>
    </ul>

    </li>
  <li>Magnetism of the new solution:
    <ul>
      <li>Simple and fast like using Simplenote</li>
      <li>Remembers my counts so I don't have to worry about being interrupted while counting and having to start over
      </li>
      <li>Easy to send counts to others. Fewer steps</li>
      <li>Keeps track of previous month's counts</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  <li>Habit of the present:
    <ul>
      <li>Simplenote is easy, like pen and paper - what if the new solution is too complicated? I like the simple, blank note that reminds me of scratch paper</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  <li>Anxiety of the new solution:
    <ul>
      <li>Counting and recording at the same time is nice, but I'm worried I'll make a mistake since I won't be looking at my phone as often</li>
      <li>The new solution seems to place importance on tracking past counts. That sounds like more stuff to learn. I'm not sure I need that capability</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>The Job-to-Be-Done</h3>
<p>At the start of this post, I mentioned what I believe is the Job-to-Be-Done by this counter app. Here it is again:</p>
<div class="block">
  <span class="context-sig">The Job Story</span>
<p>"When it's my turn to count the number of attendees in the meeting and I may be interrupted at any moment by an attendee, I want to be able to count and keep track of the current count at the same time, so that I have an accurate count to send to the record-keeper(s)."</p>
</div>
<p>I like the way the Job-to-be-Done is defined in the job outline article (here's the link again, <a href="http://jobstobedone.org/news/filling-in-leans-gaps/">http://jobstobedone.org/news/filling-in-leans-gaps/</a>):</p>
<div class="block">
  <span class="context-sig">'Job' definition from <a href="http://jobstobedone.org/news/filling-in-leans-gaps/">'Filling in Lean's Gaps'</a></span>
  <p>"The Job to be Done is not a solution, but a way of thinking about what the solution should accomplish. It’s not a shot in the dark hypothesis, but rather the result of deep thinking and a coalescing of research."<br/> - Alan Klement</p>
</div>
<p>Understanding what the solution should accomplish (the Job) is one of my prerequisites to exploring the form that the solution will take. Later, I'll begin to explore the possible forms through idea generation, sketching, prototyping, <span class="strike">and final design</span>.</p>
<h3>Idea generation, sketching, prototyping</h3>
<p>As of today, I have the following functionality built for the counter app: increment and decrement counts, add new counts from the 'all counts' screen and from the counter screen (by way of double tap), delete counts, edit a count's title, and swipe left to right to view all counts.</p>
<p>The short (quick and dirty) video below shows these features in action.</p> 

<figure>

</figure>



<h3>How did I End Up with the App in the Video Above?</h3>
<p>To review, I started this project with some research broken up into 4 stages:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Exposition - "setting the stage" by providing context surrounding customer behavior</li>
  <li>Observation - observing how the customer currently solves the problem</li>
  <li>Situational Analysis - identifying the forces acting upon the customer as they solve the problem, their (the customer's) motivations, and their desired outcomes.</li>
  <li>Job-to-be-Done - what the solution should accomplish</li>
</ol>
<p>As a reminder, below is the job story from earlier:</p>
<div class="block">
  <span class="context-sig">The Job Story</span>
<p>"When it's my turn to count the number of attendees in the meeting and I may be interrupted at any moment by an attendee, I want to be able to count and keep track of the current count at the same time, so that I have an accurate count to send to the record-keeper(s)."</p>
</div>
<p>The job story is so helpful because it's rooted in actual behavior (my behavior). Together with my observations and self-interview responses, I have greater resolution on what it is that the customer (me) is trying to get done, how I've done it in the past, what worked and didn't work, and how I'm currently getting it done.</p>

<p>From here, I set out by listing everything I knew about the problem based on my observations and analysis above. My list looked something like the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Each count should be easy to increase & decrease the current count</li>
  <li>Counts can be given titles</li>
  <li>Counts can be shared via text</li>
  <li>I want to be able to count without looking at my phone</li>
  <li>Too much typing is a pain</li>
  <li>I want fewer steps between taking count and sending count</li>
  <li>Should be simple like pen and paper</li>
  <li>Quickly start counting as soon as open app</li>
  <li>Quickly add start a new count after completing previous count</li>
  <li>Can't be more complicated than current solution</li>
  <li>Takes burden off me to remember count</li>
</ol>

<p>Next, I grouped those items that I believed were connected. For the sake of brevity, I'll only cover one such grouping:</p>
<ul class="no-bull">
  <li>1. Each count should be easy to increase & decrease the current count</li>
  <li>2. Counts can be given titles</li>
  <li>4. I want to be able to count without looking at my phone</li>
  <li>7. Should be simple like pen and paper</li>
  <li>8. Quickly start counting as soon as open app</li>
  <li>9. Quickly add start a new count after completing previous count</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided that this group of forces and motivations could best be handled by a single 'Count' screen. My next step was to sketch a few ideas for UI patterns that might resolve each of these forces and motivations.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/mystery-UI.jpg" />
  <figcaption>What's this UI gonna' be?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My first few sketches looked something like the one below. The UI is a typical pattern found in similar apps in the app store. It consists of 2 buttons for increasing and decreasing the count, a title for the count, and the current count.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/boring-ui.jpg" />
  <figcaption>Common counter pattern</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As the image above depicts, this UI pattern fails to resolve several of the forces. Under each force in the list below, I've list my reasoning why the UI fails to resolve it:</p>
<ul class="forces-list no-bull">
  <li>1. Each count should be easy to increase & decrease the current count</li>
  <li>Buttons get easier to tap as their size increases, but they still make for difficult targets when walking and counting or when counting moving objects.</li>
  <li>2. Counts can be given titles</li>
  <li>4. I want to be able to count without looking at my phone</li>
  <li>Multiple buttons require the person who is counting to look first before tapping.</li>
  <li>7. Should be simple like pen and paper</li>
  <li>8. Quickly start counting as soon as open app</li>
  <li>9. Quickly add start a new count after completing previous count</li>
  <li>This pattern usually places the capability to add a new count on a different screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, I decided to once again study my behavior as I counted people, but this time I held my phone while I counted.</p>
<p>I discovered that upon unlocking my phone and "opening the app" (I really was just opening a note taking app), I had a desire to quickly tap somewhere on the screen to start a new count. I also noticed that it's easy to tap with my thumb anywhere on the screen and perhaps I could make the entire screen a button that would increase the count. </p>
<p>Coupling that with the fact that it's fairly easy to see the glowing screen in my peripheral vision, I decided to make the screen flicker when tapped. This would allow me to keep my eyes on the objects I was counting and be sure that my taps were being registered. All that was left was to figure out the mechanic for decreasing the count.</p>
<p>I had this picture in my head of a circle drawn on the ground. Every time I tapped, it was as if I were dropping a pebble inside the circle. What does removing a pebble look like? In my mind, it looks like someone picking up a pebble and pulling it outside of the circle. I experimented with swiping left, right, up, two fingers up, etc. to "mimic" that action. I found that swiping down with the thumb or finger felt the most natural and it was also distinguishable enough from the tap gesture that I felt confident it wouldn't accidentally register as a tap. </p>
<p>Below is a rough mockup of the UI:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/final-ui.jpg" />
  <figcaption>The pattern I landed on.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I think this is a good place to end this post on the design process. Perhaps at a later date I can cover more details, but right now I'm eager to continue designing and building this app. </p>
<p>However, i would like to end with one final note on process.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<h3>What I Learned about Process</h3>

<p>I started working on the counter app a few months ago and had a strong start, in my opinion. Many sketches as well as the ideas were scribbled down in a notebook and ready for prototyping well before this post, but it just didn't happen. The reason: my mouth said "I'm going to <strong>prototype</strong> this", but my intentions were "I'm going to <strong>build</strong> this". I became focused on building a rough version of the <strong>entire</strong> app, making that a mandatory step in the process. It took a book and a podcast to shine light on my situation and begin correcting my course. The book was "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Insanely-Simple-Obsession-Drives-Success/dp/1591846218">Insanely Simple</a>" by Ken Segall and the podcast was <a href="http://www.talkingcode.com/podcast/episode-3-ryan-singer/">Talking Code</a>.</p>

  <p>In short, Insanely Simple taught me that too much process can kill ideas. Talking Code taught me not to lose sight of the context or situation that my product is "plugging into" and to make sure that the product is in fact a good fit for the situation. I realized that my focus on process was starting to become a barrier to my progress. It wasn't important whether I had a full blown application or not, I just needed to have enough of it working so that I could test it out. Fortunately, <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/">Agile Tortoise</a> released a similar app called Tally, that had two key bits of functionality that I also had in mind for my app. I didn't have to prototype some of the key functionality of my app because Agile Tortoise had already done it for me - <em>win!</em> I began to test Tally's counting and count-sharing functionality during my regular counting sessions. This not only increased my confidence in the feature choices, it also gave me insight into my expectations regarding the UI and user experience.</p>
