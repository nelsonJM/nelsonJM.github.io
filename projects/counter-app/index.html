    <p>Each month I have the task of recording the number of childcare workers and children and sharing those numbers for planning purposes. The children are outside on a playground while the child-care workers are standing or sitting nearby. I usually count while standing near a building exit which is over 100 feet away.</p>

<h3>Push and Pull</h3>
<p>Past experience, the present situation, and a hoped-for future state produce forces that push or pull me towards the different tools.</p>

  <h3>Defining Success</h3>
  <p>Based on an analysis of the information gathered from researching the domain and situation, a short story can be crafted to define what success looks like.</p>
  <div class="block">
    <h2 class="margin-top-8">"When it's my turn to report the number of kids and workers on the playground and I’m worried I’ll get distracted and forget the numbers before I record them, I want to count and record at the same time, so that I can move on to other tasks."</h2>

      <p>This short story is an informed opinion. It also serves as a metric by which designed solutions should be measured.</p>

      



<h2 id="system">System</h2>
<h3>Designing an App to Solve the Problem</h3>
<p>I decided that an app was still a good form for the solution to take. I rarely leave the house without my phone, while analog tools like pencils and scratch paper are easily forgotten. </p>
<p>From here, I set out to design the app's system.</p>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h3>Mapping the Capabilities & Prioritizing the Work</h3>
<p>Each grouping represents a capability or de-coupled area of concern. I categorized each capability and it's sub-components as one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Must Have"</li>
<li>"Necessary"</li>
<li>"Nice to Have"</li>
</ol>
<p>I decided to work on the "counting" capability first, since it is the most valuable area of the app.</p>

<h2 id="interaction">Interaction</h2>
<h3>Designing the "Count" View</h3>
<p>Referring to the "Counting" capability cluster, I began to sketch a few ideas for the count screen.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">
    <figure>
  <img src="/assets/mystery-UI.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
  <figcaption>"Counting" Capability Cluster</figcaption>
</figure>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">
    <figure>
  <img src="/assets/count-screen-sketching.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
  <figcaption>Initial sketches</figcaption>
</figure>
  </div>
</div>

<p>My first few sketches looked something like the one below. The UI is a typical pattern found in similar apps in the app store. It consists of 2 buttons for increasing and decreasing the count, a title for the count, and the current count.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/boring-ui.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
  <figcaption>Common counter pattern</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As the image above depicts, this UI pattern fails to satisfy the "Counting" cluster for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="forces-list no-bull">
  <li>1. Each count should be easy to increase & decrease the current count</li>
  <li>Buttons get easier to tap as their size increases, but they still make for difficult targets when walking and counting or when counting moving objects.</li>
  <li>2. Counts can be given titles</li>
  <li>4. I want to be able to count without looking at my phone</li>
  <li>Multiple buttons require the person who is counting to look first before tapping.</li>
  <li>7. Should be simple like pen and paper</li>
  <li>8. Quickly start counting as soon as open app</li>
  <li>9. Quickly add start a new count after completing previous count</li>
  <li>This pattern usually places the capability to add a new count on a different screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, I decided to study my behavior as I counted people, but this time I held my phone while I counted.</p>
<p>I noticed that as I counted, I moved my index finger as a way of reinforcing the "counting" action. I had the idea that I could make the entire screen a button that would register a count each time I tapped it with my finger. Also, by making the screen flash each time I tapped, I could leverage my peripheral vision to allow me to keep my eyes on the objects I was counting and be sure that my taps were being registered.</p>
<p>For decreasing the count, I experimented with swiping left, right, up, two fingers up, etc., but I found that swiping down with the thumb or finger felt the most natural and it was also distinguishable enough from the tap gesture that I felt confident it wouldn't accidentally register as a tap. </p>

<p>After a few more sketches, I arrived at the mockup below:</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption>The pattern I landed on.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Prototyping and Removing Elements</h3>
<p>I created a prototype in Xcode to explore the following:</p> 
<ul>
<li>incrementing/decrementing counts</li>
<li>adding new counts from a 'my counts' screen and from the counter screen (by way of double tap).</li>
<li>deleting counts</li>
  <li>editing a count's title</li>
  <li>swiping left to right to view all counts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reducing the Design of the "Count" View</h3>
<p>After playing with the prototype, I decided to remove the following actions from the "Count" view: adding new counts by way of double-tapping and editing the count title. Both of these actions increased the likelihood of accidentally incrementing the count.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>I believe my solution was successful because it gave me a better way to make progress that was not immediately obvious. Prior to using the new solution, I had assumed that counting and recording were necessarily 2 separate steps, i.e. “that’s just the way it is”. This solution was not a shot in the dark, but a decision based on research.</p> 
    
    <p>Style-wise, the focus on clear communication makes the app look uninteresting. On the functionality side, I think the “reset” button is awkward, positioned above the current count. I might experiment with removing the feature, since I rarely use it in practice.</p>
    
  
    <p>Overall, the solution effectively satisfies the short story because the upfront planning accounted for the facts drawn from the real-life situation of the customer.</p>
