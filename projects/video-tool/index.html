			<h1>Video Assessment Tool: Designing the Commenting capability</h1>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>I came across a software tool that allows teachers to review student videos and add comments at specific times throughout the video. I decided to make a small design challenge for myself and redesign this commenting capability.</p>

			<h2>Problem Statement or Why am I Designing this?</h2>
			<p>This is a mini-challenge to redesign one feature that is part of an assessment and reporting system for colleges and universities. </p>
			<h2>Design Process Story</h2>
		
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h3>1. Model the domain</h3>
			<p>Taking information from the video assessment page, I constructed a simple model of the domain. I listed out the concepts and terms in no particular order:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>time stamps</li>
				<li>evaluator</li>
				<li>student</li>
				<li>comment</li>
				<li>shared video</li>
				<li>etc...</li>
			</ul>
			
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<figure><a href="{{ site.url }}/images/modeling-domain.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/modeling-domain.jpg" class="img-responsive"></a></figure>
		</div>
		</div>
			<h3>2. Sketching out flows</h3>
			<p>Next, I sketched out the flow for adding a comment to a video and for sharing a video (although I restricted my focus to the commenting capability).</p>
			<p><strong>Flow for Adding a Comment:</strong> When an evaluator adds a comment, they will be taken to an "add a comment" state where they have the option to create a comment and save or cancel. In this state, they can also see a preview of the video which shows them the time stamp for their comment. After saving a new comment, the evaluator is taken back to the video watching state and the new comment appears below the video.</p> 
			<figure><a href="{{ site.url }}/images/commenting-flow.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/commenting-flow.jpg" class="img-responsive"></a></figure>
			<p><strong>Flow for Sharing:</strong> 
				When an evaluator decides to share a video (by clicking a link or button), they will be taken to a 'sharing' view where they will be able to choose with whom they would like to share via email. Possible methods of selecting email recipients include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>select from contacts list</li>
					<li>select from suggested/frequent contacts</li>
					<li>manually enter email addresses of select persons</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The flow continues with recipients receiving an email with a link to the video and comments.</p>

							<h3>3. The Capabilities: Commenting and Sharing</h3>
							<p>Commenting and sharing are two of the core capabilities that the tool offers evaluators. The commenting capability consists of:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>ability to create and save comments</li>
								<li>preview location of their comment via a video preview</li>
								<li>the recently created comment appears below the video</li>
							</ul>	
						
							<h3>4. Sketch out ideas for the interface</h3>
							<p>Finally, I began to sketch out ideas for the interface, exploring design patterns that might satisfy the requirements of the 'commenting' task:</p>

								</div>
							</div>

					<h2>Some Justification</h2>
					<p>Since I singled out commenting and sharing as the two core capabilities relevant to the activity of video evaluation, I placed their affordances (the '+ comment' button and 'share' link) in close proximity to each other and the video itself. I considered placing them below the video, but I found that my eye struggled to look down vs looking to the side. Also, placing these to the side helped keep me in the moment of the video watching experience. I placed the download link below the video, because this action signals an intention to break the video watching experience to be continued later.</p>
					<p> Adding a comment is more important and pertinent to the task so it is signaled by a large button which has the secondary effect of casting a halo and drawing attention to the 'share' link.</p>


					<h2>Really just an exercise</h2>
					<p>This was more of an exercise in attacking design problems in general since I know very little about the domain and context in which the tool is used. Knowing how customers currently use the tool, what they like and what frustrates them, would help me make tradeoffs and produce a design that is more fitting with the facts.</p>
