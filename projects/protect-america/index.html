        <h1>Home Page Redesign for Protect America</h1>
        <p>I decided to redesign the homepage of Protect America as a design exercise. I started the project with a little competitor analysis to generate some ideas and develop a direction.</p>

  My Version of the Protect America Home Page
</figure>
      <p>I studied 4 competitor home pages and judged them on 9 criteria:<br />
<ol>
  <li>Is the phone number visible? Are there calls to action?<br />
</li><li>Does the page layout make sense? Are elements aligned properly?<br />
</li><li>Can I find help when I need it? What about tolerance for my errors?<br />
</li><li>Is there a way to search the site?<br />
</li><li>How is the quality of the writing?<br />
</li><li>Does the site instill trust? Are they credible?<br />
</li><li>Are the forms intuitive?<br />
</li><li>Navigation and Information Architecture<br />
</li><li>Overall website functionality</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For each competitor I created a simple graph and plotted points representing how well the homepage satisfies my criteria. Below is the graph I produced for ADT's homepage:</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/analysis_ADT.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/analysis_ADT-300x225.jpg" alt="analysis_ADT" width="300" height="225" class="img-responsive" /></a></p>
<p>The center of the graph means the homepage doesn't quite hit the mark, the inner circle means 'half way there' and the outer circle means 'good job'. As you can see, I though ADT did a good job on all criteria except 'search'. From there, I went on to sketch out some ideas on plain 'ol paper. I quickly moved from paper to Sketch app (my favorite PS replacement) and began mocking up the homepage.</p>
