<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This is a time-tracking app for individuals and teams to track their time spent on projects.</p>
<p>It's not easy to remember to track my time at the outset of a project-related task. I am usually working on several projects throughout my day, switching from task to task and stopping mid-task to resolve the occasional emergency. Ideally, I would say something like "Ok, I'm now going to work on project B, so I'll begin tracking my time", but in reality, I just do my work and <strong>record my time later</strong>. 
</p>
<h2 id="outcome">Outcome - Defining the intended outcome of the project, the problem being solved</h2>
<p>I am interested in this part of the problem: tracking time spent on a project <em>after the fact</em>.</p>
<p>The following are capabilities the app will offer:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add time to a project for "today" and any given day.</li>
    <li>See how much time I spent on a project.</li>
    <li>See how much time my team has spent on a project.</li>
    <li>See how I spent my time this month.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="system">System - Defining the components of the system and how they are related, the features required</h2>
<p>I began with the question, "How do I add time?" and began sketching UI flows.</p>

<p>By asking this question, I had a starting point and an action that came to mind. I knew there was some screen where I could select a particular project and add time to the project. I began to sketch the flow for selecting a project, a specific date and finally entering the time spent on that project.</p>

<p>The flows lead to a system of features which I composed into a prototype.</p>

<p>The affordance for adding/subtracting time is a "scrubber" similar to those found on audio apps like SoundCloud.</p>
