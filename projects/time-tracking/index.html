<h2>Overview</h2>          
<p>This is a time-tracking app for individuals and teams to track their time spent on projects. This overview is subject to change as the design progresses.</p>
  
          
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>It's not easy to remember to track my time at the outset of a project-related task. I am usually working on several projects throughout my day, switching from task to task and stopping mid-task to resolve the occasional emergency. Ideally, I would say something like "Ok, I'm now going to work on project B, so I'll begin tracking my time", but in reality, I just do my work and <strong>record my time later</strong>. 
<p>I am interested in this part of the problem: tracking time spent on a project <em>after the fact</em>.</p>

<h2>The Design Process Story</h2>
<p>A couple of points before I get started:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I want to share the <a href="https://twitter.com/rjs/status/734870570945368064">the messy story</a> I go through to arrive at the final design.</li>
    <li>I'm interested in "adding time after the fact", but this may change as the problem shifts.</li>
  </ul> 


<h3>Main Capabilities</h3>
  <p>The following are capabilities the app will offer:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add time to a project for "today" and any given day.</li>
    <li>See how much time I spent on a project.</li>
    <li>See how much time my team has spent on a project.</li>
    <li>See how I spent my time this month.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After identifying the capabilities, I did the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wrote down words and concepts from the domain. Examples are: team and project.</li>
    <li>Sketched user flows. I began with "How do I add time to a project?".</li>
    <li>Sketched screens/views</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I made some wireframes in Sketch and used them to create a prototype with InVision. The prototype is available at the link below:
