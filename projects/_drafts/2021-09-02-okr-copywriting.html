        <div>
        <h3>Work - What I did</h3>
        <p>Researched a recurring task with the view of improving the experience. Analyzed my findings and identified what I believed the new solution should accomplish. Designed and developed the solution.</p>

        <ul class="list-disc">
        <li><a href="/assets/Counting-Outline.pdf" target="_blank">An outline</a> that captures the background, research, analysis, and a brief story of the customer's situation, anxieties, and what they hope to achieve</li>
        <li><a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/138073817?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" target="_blank">A prototype</a> (link goes to Vimeo demo video)</li>

        <h3>Outcome - What that achieved</h3>
        <p>Outline replaces many documents and guides thinking. Several pain points are removed or smoothed over. More accurate and consistent counting data.</p>

        <h3>Impact - What changed</h3>
        <p>Improved forecasting for meeting attendance. Recording of lesser known attendees (visitors, mothers with small children, etc.)</p>

<h2 id="situation">Situation & Problem</h2>
<p>Gtmhub is an OKR software product with a website that caters to enterprise customers with large teams. However, it's plausible that the company would perceive a missed opportunity to appeal to smaller teams. UX qualities such as ease of use, easy to get up and running wih, attractive integrations would remain table-stakes. Important differences between enterprise shoppers and shoppers for smaller teams: smaller teams are most likely using OKRs for the first time and/or contemplating a migration from using a spreadsheet to track OKRs, to using a dedicated OKR solution like Gtmhub.</p>


<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Create a new copy for the homepage. Re-use existing product screenshots and design elements from across the website.</p>

<h3>Counting, viewing counts & adjusting settings</h3>

  <p>Tap to increment. Swipe down to decrement. The screen flashes with each tap or swipe. <a href="https://vimeo.com/138073817" target="_blank">I created a prototype to test how this interaction felt</a>.</p>
  <p>The flashing can be turned on/off in the settings.</p>

 <h3>Sharing counts</h3>

  <p>Sharing counts creates a pre-formatted text message that includes the count title and value.</p>

 </div>
 <h3>Grouping and sharing counts</h3>

  <p>Counts can also be grouped. Changing one count will change the group's total count.</p>

 <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
 <p>I set out to create a solution that satisfied this story:<p>
   <div class="bg-grey-light p-4 mb-4">
     <p class="mb-0">"<span class="text-black">When</span> it's my turn to report the number of kids and workers on the playground and <span class="text-black color-brand">I’m worried</span> I’ll get distracted and forget the numbers before I record them, <span class="text-black color-brand">I want</span> to count and record at the same time, <span class="text-black color-brand">so that I can</span> move on to other tasks."</h2>
   </div>
     <p>This app gave me a new way to make progress on a recurring life situation. Prior to using the new solution, I had assumed that counting and recording were necessarily 2 separate steps, i.e. “that’s just the way it is”.</p>
