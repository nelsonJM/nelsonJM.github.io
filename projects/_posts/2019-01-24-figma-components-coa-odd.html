<h1 class="mb-4">Creating Components in Figma: My Takeways</h1>
<p>I used the tips from <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/component-architecture-in-figma/" target="_blank">Thomas Lowry's article</a> to decompose the City of Austin's Office of Design & Delivery homepage into components using Figma.</p>
<h2>Get the Figma file for an in-depth look.</h2>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I've found myself in the following situation: a designed webpage needs to be broken down into useful measurements that developers can use to guide build efforts while simultaneously remaining accessible to designers for additional changes.</p>
<p>I've also encountered these associated obstacles:</p>
<ol class="mb-8">
	<li>focusing on semantics too soon, e.g. "h1s should look like this..."</li>
	<li>premature "componentizing"</li>
</ol>
<p>For this exercise, I assumed that a designer has presented me with a high-fidelity concept of the following homepage:</p>
<figure>
<iframe style="border: none;" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FOG6O4F2IwIu21ihTwYiVA9xt%2FCoA%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>	
</a>
<figcaption class="text-sm">Note: The Office of Design & Delivery has since <a href="http://odd.austintexas.io/" target="_blank">trimmed down their homepage</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Overcoming Obstacle 1: Text Styles</h2>
<p>Trying to establish the global styles for all the elements: h1, h2, h3, anchors, paragraphs, etc. in a design tool vs in code. Figma's color and text styles are great because they allow designers to focus on how elements should be desired while still maintaining a constraint on the number and kind of styles.</p>
<p>For example, I identified the text styles in this homepage and Figma conveniently lists them on the design tab:</p>
<div class="w-1/3 mb-8">
	<img src="/assets/text-styles.png"/>
</div>

<p>A developer can take this list of styles and easily put it into a scale with CSS classes. The designer doesn't need to worry about whether they should use the H1 vs the H2.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Obstacle 2: Scales vs "Another component"</h2>
<p>Another tendency is to create a component when it isn't necessary. For example, instead of creating a component for each section on the homepage, I used utility-class thinking to make the spacing and background colors reusable. I created a small scale for the spacing above each heading and below each paragraph. The background colors (white and grey) are specified as 'bg-white' or 'bg-grey-light. As such, they can be applied to backgrounds that may be used in non-section parts of the UI.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are a couple of ways that Figma and Utility-class thinking is helping me solve the problem of communicating design requirements to developers while preserving the ability to make design changes in the design tool.</p>
