<h1 class="mb-4">Creating Components in Figma: My Takeways</h1>
<p>I used the tips from <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/component-architecture-in-figma/" target="_blank">Thomas Lowry's article</a> to decompose the City of Austin's Office of Design & Delivery homepage into components using Figma.</p>
<p>I plan to update this post, just need to collect my notes.</p>

<h2>Figma Embed</h2>
<iframe style="border: none;" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FOG6O4F2IwIu21ihTwYiVA9xt%2FCoA%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>For this exercise, I assumed that a designer has just presented me with a high-fidelity concept of the following homepage:</p>
<div class="w-1/3"><figure>
	<a href="/assets/odd-homepage.jpg" target="_blank">
	<img src="/assets/odd-homepage-preview.jpg"/>
</a>
<figcaption class="text-sm">Note: The Office of Design & Delivery has since <a href="http://odd.austintexas.io/" target="_blank">trimmed down their homepage</a>.</figcaption></figure></div>
