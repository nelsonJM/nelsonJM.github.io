<h2 id="situation">Situation & Problem</h2>
<p>"Can you tell me what typeface that is?" I've been asked this question a few times over the years.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>How do you develop your typeface-identifying ability? There are apps that display some text, styled in a particular typeface, and ask you to identify the typeface. I'm looking for something that forces me to focus on the anatomy of the type.</p>
<h2 id="solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>I decided to create a quiz that highlighted and explained the defining characteristics of the typeface in question.</p>
<p><a href="https://jmarknel.com/Font-Identity-Quiz/" target="_blank">Give the quiz a try</a>.</p>

<h3>The "Question" view</h3>
<p>This screen seems to be 90% <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch09_Epicenter_Design.php">epicenter</a> - the giant word with the 'highlighting' of the typeface anatomy. I explored a few options before landing on the dashed circles and lines.</p>

<h3>The "Final Score" view</h3>

<p>Quiz takers enter through the home page, go through a series of question screens, and end on the final score page. What would I expect to see after I answered the last question?</p>
<p>For me, it was the following:</p>
<ul class="mb-8"><li>  my score
  </li><li>  my answers
  </li><li>  the correct answers
  </li><li>  some explanation for each answer
  </li><li>  my options for where to go next
  </li><li>  some indication of how awesome I am (or not)
  </li><li>  I don't want to travel to other pages to satisfy these points
  </li><li>  how I did compared to other quiz takers
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I made the decision to focus on the early steps in the interface design process and reserve styling for later. I've tried the opposite approach - focusing on things like color, typography, etc. and trying to make things look great from the start - but that always delayed project completion and left important problems unsolved. I think this helped me focus on the purpose of the project.</p>
<p>I built this quiz to learn about typefaces and JavaScript. This was a great experience exercising my design muscles to build something for myself.</p>
