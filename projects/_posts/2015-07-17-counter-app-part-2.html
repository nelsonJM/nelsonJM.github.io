excerpt: Continuing the counter app design. Here are some initial ideas, sketches, and a "final" product concept. Also, a lesson learned on the stifling effect of too much process.

<p>As of today, 9/2/15, I have the following functionality built for the counter app: increment and decrement counts, add new counts from the 'all counts' screen and from the counter screen (by way of double tap), delete counts, edit a count's title, and swipe left to right to view all counts.</p>
<p>The short (quick and dirty) video below shows these features in action.</p>

<h2>Coming up with UI Ideas</h2>
<p>In deciding what capabilities the app should provide and what should be on the screen, I refer often to the job story:</p>
<div class="block">
	<span class="context-sig">The Job Story</span>
<p>"When it's my turn to count the number of attendees in the meeting and I may be interrupted at any moment by an attendee, I want to be able to count and keep track of the current count at the same time, so that I have an accurate count to send to the record-keeper(s)."</p>
</div>
<p>The job story is so helpful because it's rooted in actual behavior (my behavior). Together with my observations and self-interview responses, I have greater resolution on what it is that the customer (me) is trying to get done, how I've done it in the past, what worked and didn't work, and how I'm currently getting it done.</p>

<h2>Let's Focus on Counting</h2>
	<p>Instead of writing a mega post on every consideration/sketch/idea/etc. I'll just cover how I tackled what I believe is the most important feature: counting stuff.</p>


<h2>What I Learned about Process</h2>

<p>I started working on the counter app a few months ago and had a strong start, in my opinion. Many of the sketches that are in this post as well as the ideas were already scribbled down in a notebook and ready for prototyping, but it just didn't happen. The reason: my mouth said "I'm going to <strong>prototype</strong> this", but my intentions were "I'm going to <strong>build</strong> this". I became focused on building a rough version of the <strong>entire</strong> app, making that a mandatory step in the process. It took a book and a podcast to shine light on my situation and begin correcting my course. The book was "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Insanely-Simple-Obsession-Drives-Success/dp/1591846218">Insanely Simple</a>" by Ken Segall and the podcast was <a href="http://www.talkingcode.com/podcast/episode-3-ryan-singer/">Talking Code</a>.</p>

	<p>In short, Insanely Simple taught me that too much process can kill ideas. Talking Code taught me not to lose sight of the context or situation that my product is "plugging into" and to make sure that the product is in fact a good fit for the situation. I realized that my focus on process was starting to become a barrier to my progress. It wasn't important whether I had a full blown application or not, I just needed to have enough of it working so that I could test it out. Fortunately, <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/">Agile Tortoise</a> released a similar app called Tally, that had two key bits of functionality that I also had in mind for my app. I didn't have to prototype some of the key functionality of my app because Agile Tortoise had already done it for me - <em>win!</em> I began to test Tally's counting and count-sharing functionality during my regular counting sessions. This not only increased my confidence in the feature choices, it also gave me insight into my expectations regarding the UI and user experience.</p>
