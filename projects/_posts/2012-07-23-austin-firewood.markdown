<p>This was my first official project, a site redesign, for Austin Firewood. With help from Khoi Vinh's <a href="http://grids.subtraction.com/">Ordering Disorder: Grid Principles for Web Design</a> and Mark Boulton's grid course on <a href="http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/">Five Simple Steps</a>, I started with a custom grid that I created in Photoshop. The site is coded in HTML, CSS, jQuery and PHP.</p>
<p>In designing the site, I focused on typography, texture, and color. The client and I determined that the main selling points (located in the red banner at the top) should be prominent and the product offering should be clear. We decided that most customers would not know how much wood was in a cord, so we needed to visually communicate the size/amount of wood that was being purchased. I accomplished these two objectives by placing the selling points in a prominent position and including product dimensions along with pictures of each product.</p>
