  <h2 id="situation">Situation & Problem</h2>
  <p>I wanted a more convenient way for reviewing design principles and practicing design techniques. The content of these cards came from a highly technical book on visual communication.</p>
  <p>I wanted a solution that made the content more accessible both at my desk and when I'm away.</p>
  
  <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
  <p>Create 6 small card decks that focus on visual communication design principles, goals, and techniques.</p>

  <h3>Sketch as a print design tool</h3>
  <p>The playing cards supplier had printing dimensions available on their website. I designed the cards using their measurements, however, after sending them my design files and seeing the prototype, I wasn't pleased with the results. I made a few adjustments in Sketch and was ready to print the first batch.</p>

  <p>On the back of each card is the applicable design principles (e.g. Clarity, Harmony, Activity, Restraint) and goals (e.g. Scale, Contrast, Proportion). The content is a step in a technique that achieves the design goals.</p>
