<h2 id="situation">Situation & Problem</h2>
<p>I'm tasked with counting and recording people. I also share those numbers with others via text message.</p>
<p>Moving targets are hard to count and interruptions can force a re-count. Existing tools require a free moment for the eyes, brain, and fingers.</p>
<h3>Defining success with a short story</h3>
  <div class="bg-grey-light p-4 mb-4">
    <p class="mb-0">"<span class="text-black">When</span> it's my turn to report the number of kids and workers on the playground and <span class="text-black color-brand">I’m worried</span> I’ll get distracted and forget the numbers before I record them, <span class="text-black color-brand">I want</span> to count and record at the same time, <span class="text-black color-brand">so that I can</span> move on to other tasks."</h2>
  </div>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Create a counter app that allows me to count without looking away.</p>

<h3>Counting, viewing counts & adjusting settings</h3>

  <p>Tap to increment. Swipe down to decrement. The screen flashes with each tap or swipe. <a href="https://vimeo.com/138073817" target="_blank">I created a prototype to test how this interaction felt</a>.</p>
  <p>The flashing can be turned on/off in the settings.</p>

 </div>

 <h3>Sharing counts</h3>

  <p>Sharing counts creates a pre-formatted text message that includes the count title and value.</p>

 </div>
 <h3>Grouping and sharing counts</h3>

  <p>Counts can also be grouped. Changing one count will change the group's total count.</p>

 <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
 <p>I set out to create a solution that satisfied this story:<p>
   <div class="bg-grey-light p-4 mb-4">
     <p class="mb-0">"<span class="text-black">When</span> it's my turn to report the number of kids and workers on the playground and <span class="text-black color-brand">I’m worried</span> I’ll get distracted and forget the numbers before I record them, <span class="text-black color-brand">I want</span> to count and record at the same time, <span class="text-black color-brand">so that I can</span> move on to other tasks."</h2>
   </div>
     <p>This app gave me a new way to make progress on a recurring life situation. Prior to using the new solution, I had assumed that counting and recording were necessarily 2 separate steps, i.e. “that’s just the way it is”.</p>
