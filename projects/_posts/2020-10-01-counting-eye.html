        <div>
        <h3>Work - What I did</h3>
        <p>Researched a recurring task with the view of improving the experience. Analyzed my findings and identified what I believed the new solution should accomplish. Designed and developed the solution.</p>

        <ul class="list-disc">
        <li><a href="/assets/Counting-Outline.pdf" target="_blank">An outline</a> that captures the background, research, analysis, and a brief story of the customer's situation, anxieties, and what they hope to achieve</li>

        <h3>Outcome - What that achieved</h3>
        <p>Outline replaces many documents and guides thinking. Several pain points are removed or smoothed over. More accurate and consistent counting data.</p>

        <p>Improved forecasting for meeting attendance. Recording of lesser known attendees (visitors, mothers with small children, etc.)</p>

<h2 id="situation">Situation & Problem</h2>
<p>I'm tasked with counting and recording people. I also share those numbers with others via text message.</p>
<p>Moving targets are hard to count and interruptions can force a re-count. Existing tools require a free moment for the eyes, brain, and fingers.</p>

  <h2 id="observation">Observing Behavior & Interviewing</h2>
<p>I followed other count takers around and observed their behavior. Here's what the counting process looked like:</p>
  <img src="/assets/existing-process.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
<p>I interviewed count takers regarding their behavior and the products they currently use and have used in the past.</p>
<img src="/assets/counter-forces.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
<h2 id="outcome">Desired Outcome</h2>
<p>Defining success with a short story:</p>
  <div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 mb-4">
    <p class="mb-0">"<span class="text-black">When</span> it's my turn to report the number of kids and workers on the playground and <span class="text-black color-brand">I’m worried</span> I’ll get distracted and forget the numbers before I record them, <span class="text-black color-brand">I want</span> to count and record at the same time, <span class="text-black color-brand">so that I can</span> move on to other tasks."</h2>
  </div>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Create a counter app that allows me to count without looking away.</p>

<h2 id="ideation">Ideation & Sketching</h2>
<h3>Braindump & Cluster</h3>
<p>I wrote down everything that I believed the app needed to be and accomplish. This became a list of items that I grouped into clusters.</p>
<img src="/assets/list-and-cluster.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
<h3>UI Flows</h3>
<p>Sketched out a rough schematic of how the customer interacts with the system. It also lets me refine the clusters and discover new clusters.</p>

<h3>Sketching Screens</h3>
<p>Initial sketches using typical pattern found in similar apps - 2 buttons for increasing and decreasing the count, a title for the count, and the current count.</p>
<img src="/assets/count-screen-sketching.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
<img src="/assets/boring-ui.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
<h3>Choosing a pattern</h3>
<p>This UI pattern satisfies the "Counting" cluster identified during the ‘Brain dump & cluster’ phase.</p>

<h2 id="visual">Visual & Interaction Design</h2>

<h3>Counting, viewing counts & adjusting settings</h3>

  <p>Tap to increment. Swipe down to decrement. The screen flashes with each tap or swipe. <a href="https://vimeo.com/138073817" target="_blank">I created a prototype to test how this interaction felt</a>.</p>
  <p>The flashing can be turned on/off in the settings.</p>

 </div>

 <h3>Sharing counts</h3>

  <p>Sharing counts creates a pre-formatted text message that includes the count title and value.</p>

 </div>
 <h3>Grouping and sharing counts</h3>

  <p>Counts can also be grouped. Changing one count will change the group's total count.</p>

 <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
 <p>I set out to create a solution that satisfied this story:<p>
   <div class="bg-grey-light p-4 mb-4">
     <p class="mb-0">"<span class="text-black">When</span> it's my turn to report the number of kids and workers on the playground and <span class="text-black color-brand">I’m worried</span> I’ll get distracted and forget the numbers before I record them, <span class="text-black color-brand">I want</span> to count and record at the same time, <span class="text-black color-brand">so that I can</span> move on to other tasks."</h2>
   </div>
     <p>This app gave me a new way to make progress on a recurring life situation. Prior to using the new solution, I had assumed that counting and recording were necessarily 2 separate steps, i.e. “that’s just the way it is”.</p>
