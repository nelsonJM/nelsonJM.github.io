<h3>Counting, viewing counts & adjusting settings</h3>

  <p>Tap to increment. Swipe down to decrement. The screen flashes with each tap or swipe. <a href="https://vimeo.com/138073817" target="_blank">I created a prototype to test how this interaction felt</a>.</p>
  <p>The flashing can be turned on/off in the settings.</p>

  <p>Sharing counts creates a pre-formatted text message that includes the count title and value.</p>

 <h3>Grouping and sharing counts</h3>

  <p>Counts can also be grouped. Changing one count will change the group's total count.</p>
