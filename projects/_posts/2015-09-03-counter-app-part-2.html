excerpt: Built a few key features and wired up the interface. Did it all in Xcode. I also cover some of my process for designing the counter screen and share a lesson learned on the stifling effect of too much process.
---
<p>As of today, I have the following functionality built for the counter app: increment and decrement counts, add new counts from the 'all counts' screen and from the counter screen (by way of double tap), delete counts, edit a count's title, and swipe left to right to view all counts.</p>
<p>The short (quick and dirty) video below shows these features in action.</p>

<h2>How did I End Up with the App in the Video Above?</h2>
<p>To review, I started this project with some research broken up into 4 stages:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Exposition - "setting the stage" by providing context surrounding customer behavior</li>
	<li>Observation - observing how the customer currently solves the problem</li>
	<li>Situational Analysis - identifying the forces acting upon the customer as they solve the problem, their (the customer's) motivations, and their desired outcomes.</li>
	<li>Job-to-be-Done - what the solution should accomplish</li>
</ol>
<p>As a reminder, below is the job story I listed in Part I:</p>
<div class="block">
	<span class="context-sig">The Job Story</span>
<p>"When it's my turn to count the number of attendees in the meeting and I may be interrupted at any moment by an attendee, I want to be able to count and keep track of the current count at the same time, so that I have an accurate count to send to the record-keeper(s)."</p>
</div>
<p>The job story is so helpful because it's rooted in actual behavior (my behavior). Together with my observations and self-interview responses, I have greater resolution on what it is that the customer (me) is trying to get done, how I've done it in the past, what worked and didn't work, and how I'm currently getting it done.</p>

<p>From here, I set out by listing everything I knew about the problem based on my observations and analysis above. My list looked something like the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Each count should be easy to increase & decrease the current count</li>
	<li>Counts can be given titles</li>
	<li>Counts can be shared via text</li>
	<li>I want to be able to count without looking at my phone</li>
	<li>Too much typing is a pain</li>
	<li>I want fewer steps between taking count and sending count</li>
	<li>Should be simple like pen and paper</li>
	<li>Quickly start counting as soon as open app</li>
	<li>Quickly add start a new count after completing previous count</li>
	<li>Can't be more complicated than current solution</li>
	<li>Takes burden off me to remember count</li>
</ol>

<p>Next, I grouped those items that I believed were connected. For the sake of brevity, I'll only cover one such grouping:</p>
<ul class="no-bull">
	<li>1. Each count should be easy to increase & decrease the current count</li>
	<li>2. Counts can be given titles</li>
	<li>4. I want to be able to count without looking at my phone</li>
	<li>7. Should be simple like pen and paper</li>
	<li>8. Quickly start counting as soon as open app</li>
	<li>9. Quickly add start a new count after completing previous count</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided that this group of forces and motivations could best be handled by a single 'Count' screen. My next step was to sketch a few ideas for UI patterns that might resolve each of these forces and motivations.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="/assets/mystery-UI.jpg" />
	<figcaption>What's this UI gonna' be?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My first few sketches looked something like the one below. The UI is a typical pattern found in similar apps in the app store. It consists of 2 buttons for increasing and decreasing the count, a title for the count, and the current count.</p>

</figure>

<p>As the image above depicts, this UI pattern fails to resolve several of the forces. Under each force in the list below, I've list my reasoning why the UI fails to resolve it:</p>
<ul class="forces-list no-bull">
	<li>1. Each count should be easy to increase & decrease the current count</li>
	<li>Buttons get easier to tap as their size increases, but they still make for difficult targets when walking and counting or when counting moving objects.</li>
	<li>2. Counts can be given titles</li>
	<li>4. I want to be able to count without looking at my phone</li>
	<li>Multiple buttons require the person who is counting to look first before tapping.</li>
	<li>7. Should be simple like pen and paper</li>
	<li>8. Quickly start counting as soon as open app</li>
	<li>9. Quickly add start a new count after completing previous count</li>
	<li>This pattern usually places the capability to add a new count on a different screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, I decided to once again study my behavior as I counted people, but this time I held my phone while I counted.</p>
<p>I discovered that upon unlocking my phone and "opening the app" (I really was just opening a note taking app), I had a desire to quickly tap somewhere on the screen to start a new count. I also noticed that it's easy to tap with my thumb anywhere on the screen and perhaps I could make the entire screen a button that would increase the count. </p>
<p>Coupling that with the fact that it's fairly easy to see the glowing screen in my peripheral vision, I decided to make the screen flicker when tapped. This would allow me to keep my eyes on the objects I was counting and be sure that my taps were being registered. All that was left was to figure out the mechanic for decreasing the count.</p>
<p>I had this picture in my head of a circle drawn on the ground. Every time I tapped, it was as if I were dropping a pebble inside the circle. What does removing a pebble look like? In my mind, it looks like someone picking up a pebble and pulling it outside of the circle. I experimented with swiping left, right, up, two fingers up, etc. to "mimic" that action. I found that swiping down with the thumb or finger felt the most natural and it was also distinguishable enough from the tap gesture that I felt confident it wouldn't accidentally register as a tap. </p>
<p>Below is a rough mockup of the UI:</p>

<p>I think this is a good place to end this post on the design process. Perhaps at a later date I can cover more details, but right now I'm eager to continue designing and building this app. </p>
<p>However, i would like to end with one final note on process.</p>
<h2>What I Learned about Process</h2>

<p>I started working on the counter app a few months ago and had a strong start, in my opinion. Many sketches as well as the ideas were scribbled down in a notebook and ready for prototyping well before this post, but it just didn't happen. The reason: my mouth said "I'm going to <strong>prototype</strong> this", but my intentions were "I'm going to <strong>build</strong> this". I became focused on building a rough version of the <strong>entire</strong> app, making that a mandatory step in the process. It took a book and a podcast to shine light on my situation and begin correcting my course. The book was "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Insanely-Simple-Obsession-Drives-Success/dp/1591846218">Insanely Simple</a>" by Ken Segall and the podcast was <a href="http://www.talkingcode.com/podcast/episode-3-ryan-singer/">Talking Code</a>.</p>

	<p>In short, Insanely Simple taught me that too much process can kill ideas. Talking Code taught me not to lose sight of the context or situation that my product is "plugging into" and to make sure that the product is in fact a good fit for the situation. I realized that my focus on process was starting to become a barrier to my progress. It wasn't important whether I had a full blown application or not, I just needed to have enough of it working so that I could test it out. Fortunately, <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/">Agile Tortoise</a> released a similar app called Tally, that had two key bits of functionality that I also had in mind for my app. I didn't have to prototype some of the key functionality of my app because Agile Tortoise had already done it for me - <em>win!</em> I began to test Tally's counting and count-sharing functionality during my regular counting sessions. This not only increased my confidence in the feature choices, it also gave me insight into my expectations regarding the UI and user experience.</p>
