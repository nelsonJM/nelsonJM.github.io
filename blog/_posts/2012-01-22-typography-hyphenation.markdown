<p>I recently read an article on Smashing Magazine about the en and em dashes and how hyphens do not equal dashes. The article mentioned Robert Bringhurst's book, <a title="Link to buy The Elements of Typographic Style at Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063">The Elements of Typographic Style</a>, so I decided to revisit my copy (I purchased it last month and have only read a few pages so far). I came across the following "nugget" of hyphenation knowledge:</p>
<p>"2.4.1 <em>At hyphenated line-ends, leave at least two characters behind and take at least three forward.</em>"</p>
<p>I think this is a pretty straightforward rule that probably doesn't need an example. It basically means that if you're typing a sentence and you have to hyphenate the last word before starting a new line, position the hyphen so that at least 2 of the characters in the last word remain behind and at least 3 characters proceed to the new line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's another rule:</p>
<p>"<em>2.4.2 Avoid leaving the stub-end of a hyphenated word or any word shorter than four letters, as the last line of a paragraph.</em>"</p>
<p>I thought these rules were interesting and I wanted to put them into a post mainly for my personal reference.</p>
