<ul>
	<li>How do I take people through a process</li>
	<li>How do I decompose the problem into specific tasks that matter to the user</li>
	<li>When I have the specific task that the user is trying to do, how do I think of that in terms of screens that I need to provide, elements on the screen, then a flow through time</li>
	<li>How do I cluster the features and which ones need to be accessible relative to each other</li>
	<li>What is the value of this addition relative to shipping</li>
	<li>What are the different affordances that I need to have on that space</li>
	<li>I have this space, what do I need to have on there</li>
	<li>What do people need to see</li>
	<li>What needs to be present here in order to afford the actions that people need to conform, to do the job</li>
	<li>Is the function what matters to the customer right now? or is it more the emotional thing</li>
	<li>If I have 3-4 different tasks I need to offer on the same screen, how do I position them relative to each other? how do I emphasize one button and deemphasize another button and why</li>
	<li>Which things are important here</li>
	<li>Why am I doing what I'm doing</li>
	<li>Why am I puting this label here</li>
	<li>Why am i writing this headline</li>
	<li>Why is this paragraph here</li>
	<li>Why would somebody read it, what is its purpose</li>
	<li>What am I doing here, why am I doing it, why would somebody read it, why would it be interesting to them, what is important</li>
	<li>How did you get here</li>
	<li>What did somebody do to get here</li>
	<li>Where are they going next</li>
	<li>I'm here, and I need to get there - How do I do it? What does that process feel like</li>
	<li>What is the purpose, what is the goal</li>
	<li>What is the definition of progress</li>
	<li>Why is somebody using this and where are they trying to go with it?</li>
	<li>How do you guide people through a process on screen, use the right words to ring the right bells as they scan, and impress the functional possibilities into their intuition without asking them to think overtly</li>
	<li>When somebody is in a certain situation, what are they really trying to do and how do they define value relative to what they're trying to do</li>
	<li>How did you end up here? what happened that you're buying</li>
	<li>What can we do to help this person decide that this the right tool for them</li>
	<li>What's really important to us</li>
	<li>What screen matters the most</li>
	<li>What screen is going to make me think about the words I'm going to use, domain, main elements there, the data I'm going to draw from, the simplest screen that satisfies all these needs</li>
	<li>How did you get there and what's going to happen when you're done</li>
	<li>How do we start this whole thing</li>
	<li>How many things can you show on a screen at once? how many things can you read on a screen at once</li>
