<p>One of the books I've been reading is <a href="http://www.smashinglogodesign.net/">Smashing Logo Design by Gareth Hardy</a>. I spent part of my lunch break reading about the different types of logos and drawing logos for a website I'm working on. In this post I'll simply list the main types of logos.</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<p>Pictorial marks - drawings. Example: Apple logo.</p>
<p>Abstract &amp; symbolic marks - a nonliteral intrepretation of a concept, idea, or belief held by the person or organization to whom the logo belongs. Example: Nike swoosh.</p>
<p>Emblems - a surrounding shape and the name of the organization or individual. They help give people a more personal relationship with the brand. Example: Soccer teams or clubs.</p>
<p>Characters/mascots - make organizations seem fun and not so serious. Example: the monopoly guy.</p>
<p>The following are<strong> typographic logos:</strong></p>
<p>Wordmarks - displays the name of a brand or individual in a text-only graphic representation. An example is the Coca-cola logo.</p>
<p>Letterforms - a logo that uses a single letter or number is a letterform. The Honda logo is a great example of a letterform logo.</p>
<p>Monograms - a combination of two or more typographic characters to form a logo. Example: The Chanel 'C' repeated twice with one 'C' reversed.</p>
