<p>This year I was asked to build a website that featured local-approved spots around town (Austin, Texas). The site is called ATXexplorers.com and was launched earlier this month. Of course, 'launched' doesn't mean 'finished'. There are still rough edges that need to be smoothed down and other design decisions that need to be made.</p>
<p>I created a custom WordPress theme for the site using the Underscores theme (my favorite starter theme). I would really like to give a more detailed run-down of the site build process in a later post, but with so many other projects and things I would like to build, it might be tough. I think it would be very helpful to those people who are just starting to build websites with WordPress. I'd also like to talk about how I use Sass, Compass, and other tools that are part of a modern workflow and hear how others use these tools. I'll try my best to act on these wishes. Adios!</p>
