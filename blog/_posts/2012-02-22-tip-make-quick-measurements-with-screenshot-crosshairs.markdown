<p>I was recently watching a video on <a title="Tuts Plus Premium website" href="http://tutsplus.com/">Tuts+ Premium</a> and picked up a neat tip to help with taking quick measurements using the Macbook's screen capture crosshairs.</p>
<p>The setup: You're coding a website and switching between your text editor, browser and .psd mockup. Maybe you want to double check that an element really is 13px to the right of another element, just like it is in your mockup. What do you do? You press CMD + Shift + 4 and right-click to bring up the screenshot crosshairs as if you were going to take a screenshot. Next, you drag the crosshairs across the distance you want to measure. As you drag, a transparent box appears along with the height and width of the box. Using the box as a guide, you now can quickly determine the distance between most of the elements on your web page.</p>
