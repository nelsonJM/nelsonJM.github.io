<p>Just some quick facts about <strong>Oldstyle</strong>Â and <strong>Modern</strong> typefaces. Some examples of Oldstyle typefaces are Goudy, Palatino, Times, Baskerville, and Garamond. The typefaces that fall into this category always have serifs and the serifs of lowercase letters are always at an angle (the angle of a pen). Their curved strokes have a transition from thick to thin (another result of the pen) and if you were to draw a line through the thinnest parts of the curved strokes, the line would be diagonal. This is called a diagonal stress and it is a characteristic of Oldstyle type.</p>
<p>Modern typefaces are Bodoni, Times Bold, Onyx, Didot, and Bold Walbaum. The serifs, unlike those of Oldstyle typefaces, are horizontal (not slanted). The serifs are also very thin. The strokes of Modern typefaces display radical transitions from thick to thin. If you were to draw a line through the thinnest parts of the curved strokes, the line would be vertical.</p>
