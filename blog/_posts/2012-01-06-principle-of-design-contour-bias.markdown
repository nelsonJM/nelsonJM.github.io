<p>Inspired by Andy Rutledge's article '<a href="http://www.andyrutledge.com/creativity-is-not-design-test-2.php">Creativity is Not Design</a>', I purchased the book titled 'Universal Principles of Design' with the goal of reading one principle a day. Today I read about Contour Bias or the tendency to favor objects with contours over objects with sharp angles or points. Studies have shown that when presented with an object with sharp angles, the part of the brain associated with fear processing, known as the amygdala, is activated. Without getting into the details, the degree of activation is proportional to the degree of angularity of the object presented. In short, objects with contours are preferred over objects with sharp angles. An interesting point is that although the sharp objects are less desirable, they elicit greater interest and deeper thought processing. As stated in the book, "Angular objects are more effective at attracting attention and engaging thought; contoured objects are more effective at making a positive emotional and aesthetic impression."</p>
