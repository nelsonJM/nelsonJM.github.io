<p style="text-align: center;">This photo is on the homepage of churchinaustin.org, a website that I helped revamp over the summer.  I'd like to share the steps I took to arrive at the "After" photo.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-171" title="comparison" src="/assets/uploads/2011/09/comparison1.png" alt="" width="300" height="501" /></p>
<p> The photo was taken at dusk when the green evening lights of the meeting hall were turned on.  While the green light emanating from the staircase makes for a great Emerald City effect, it was not the look we were going for.  The goal was to make the picture warm and inviting like the people who meet there.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-167"></a></p>
<p>I decided to use a technique that I picked up from Deke McClelland's Photoshop series at Lynda.com.  Since I didn't document my work flow as I was working, I'm regurgitating what I can I remember.  If something seems like it's out of sequence or doesn't make sense, my apologies.</p>
<p><strong>Unsharp Mask</strong></p>
<p>I started off by applying an Unsharp Mask to the photo.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/uploads/2011/09/unsm.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-198" title="unsm" src="/assets/uploads/2011/09/unsm.jpg" alt="Picture of Unsharp Mask box" width="333" height="441" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Content Aware Scale</strong></p>
<p>To make the photo look more like a landscape shot, I used Content Aware Scale, but first I adjusted the canvas size by adding an extra 100 px to the width.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/uploads/2011/09/canvassize.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-199" title="canvassize" src="/assets/uploads/2011/09/canvassize.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="412" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/assets/uploads/2011/09/caws_w.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-201" title="caws_w" src="/assets/uploads/2011/09/caws_w-300x180.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>Then, using Content Aware Scale, I adjusted the height and width until I got something like the image below.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-200" title="caws" src="/assets/uploads/2011/09/caws-300x184.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="184" /></p>
<p><strong>Masking</strong></p>
<p>Next, I created a solid fill layer and changed the mask to black to reveal the layer beneath it.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/uploads/2011/09/solidfill.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-202" title="solidfill" src="/assets/uploads/2011/09/solidfill.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="377" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/uploads/2011/09/solidfilllayer.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-203" title="solidfilllayer" src="/assets/uploads/2011/09/solidfilllayer.jpg" alt="" width="509" height="611" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Paintbrush tool</strong></p>
<p>Using the eyedropper tool, I selected a color from the structure of the meeting hall to replace the green glowing color of the stairs.  Next, using the Paintbrush tool and with the layer mask selected, I began to paint the green areas of the staircase, which was pretty much the entire staircase.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/uploads/2011/09/paintnohue.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-204" title="paintnohue" src="/assets/uploads/2011/09/paintnohue-1024x570.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="378" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I painted over as much of the green light as I could without painting over areas that were fine.  Ultimately, I ended up with something like this:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-10-08-at-5.11.11-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-208" title="Screen shot 2011-10-08 at 5.11.11 PM" src="/assets/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-10-08-at-5.11.11-PM-1024x640.png" alt="" width="680" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Blendmodes</p>
<p>Changing the blend mode from Normal to Hue gave me the following result:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/uploads/2011/09/afterHue1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-211" title="afterHue" src="/assets/uploads/2011/09/afterHue1-1024x560.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="371" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Levels adjustment layer</p>
<p>Finally, I applied a Levels adjustment layer...</p>
<p><a href="/assets/uploads/2011/09/levels.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-213" title="levels" src="/assets/uploads/2011/09/levels.jpg" alt="" width="351" height="715" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>which resulted in this...</p>
<p><a href="/assets/uploads/2011/09/finalprod.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-214" title="final product" src="/assets/uploads/2011/09/finalprod-1024x560.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="371" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now this isn't <em>really </em>the final product because from here I used the Clone stamp tool to remove the white car, green power boxes, light posts, and artifacts in the sky.   The good news is that the green light is gone and we have a warmer, more welcoming meeting hall entrance.  Thanks for following along!</p>
