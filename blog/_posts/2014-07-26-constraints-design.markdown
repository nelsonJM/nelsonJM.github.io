<p>I recently read the <a href="http://37signals.com/rework/">Rework</a> book <a href="http://www.squeezedbooks.com/articles/rework.html">summary at Squeezed Books</a>. There is a point made in the book, under the heading, 'Embrace constraints', that I have been thinking about: </p>
<p><strong>"Limited resources force you to make do with what you’ve got. There’s no room for waste. And that forces you to be creative."</strong> - Jason Fried; David Heinemeier Hansson - Rework</p>
<p>One thing I love about design is the idea that constraints are a good thing. The book describes them as "advantages in disguise". At first they seem unreasonable or stupid, but actually they can free you from a host of design solutions. You could always ignore the limitations and do whatever feels right, but the result will probably be inappropriate or feel out of tune with the environment.</p>
<p>Rework offers an example of "creativity" in an environment of constraints: the crude weapons fashioned by prison inmates. It's kind of a gross example, but it does make a point that prisoners take artifacts from their limited environment and forge weapons that are effective at satisfying their ill intent. </p>
<p>Taking this process one step forward, the discovery of these crude weapons by prison guards hopefully results in the improvement of security. In other words, the limited environment that influenced the creation of the weapon is now influenced by the weapon and adapts accordingly.</p>
<p>I'd like to apply this to the world of designing websites. Let's say you're working on a site with a history of poor design decisions, a visual aesthetic that has borrowed from various trends throughout the years, and a host of requirements/ideas cherry-picked from competitor websites. What do you do? I don't have the answer, but I'm willing to try designing something that at first blush is crude, ugly, whatever you want to call it, but also appropriate and effective. It could be a simple paragraph of text and some bullet points or the placement of a small piece of text that makes enough impact on someone who cares and has the power to change the environment. </p>
