    <p>There are at least 2 different definitions of affordances. The one I have experience with goes something like "affordances are things in the environment with which you can act". Some examples are door handles <em>afford</em> opening a door and walking through. Buttons, sliders, toggles, etc. <em>afford</em> various actions.</p>
    <p>Affordances are what connect the screens of a given flow.</p>
    <p>Some questions you can ask to determine whether you are <em>affording</em> a capability or not:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc mb-5">
        <li>Does this change affect whether a user can discover the feature?</li>
        <li>Does it clarify how to operate it?</li>
        <li>What am I helping them to do right now?</li>
    </ul>
