    <p>Epicenter design means identifying the purpose of a given screen and designing the key UI elements first, then identifying the next most important elements, and so on. It's about asking "what part of this screen, when removed, will take away the purpose of the screen?"</p>
    <h2>Determining big questions</h2>
    <p>What's the purpose of this page? What's it trying to say? What's the overall structure?</p>
    <h2>Picking a medium</h2>
    <p>Which medium gives me the clearest answer to my questions in the least amount of time?</p>
    <ul class="list-disc">
        <li>Increasing fidelity (from text to code)</li>
        <li>Selectively decreasing fidelity (from code to sketch)</li>
    </ul>
</div>
