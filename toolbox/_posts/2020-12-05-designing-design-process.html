intro: Faced with a new project - should you apply a complex, exploration-based design process or a light-weight, intuition-based one? I created a worksheet based on the framework Intercom uses to decide.

<p>I studied Intercom's design process framework - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrbJRZAu4hU&t=892s" target="_blank">presented by Alex Potrivaev</a> - and decided to create an artifact that I could use for future projects as a reference. In the video above, I walk through the artifact.</p>

<h3>I created a worksheet</h3>
<p>No need to watch/re-watch Alex's presentation. I have a simple, clear document that I can use to recall the important points and share the framework with others.</p>

<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-OPdIjQWH8OL4qdXUEqZ05nRBgJDVdM/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">A blank PDF worksheet</a> to be filled out on your next project</li>

<p>"Design process" can be a daunting topic. There are so many methods to choose from and it can be tempting to think a one-size-fits-all approach is necessary. This framework makes it easier to tailor your process to the needs of the project by forcing you to ask/answer fundamental questions.</p>
