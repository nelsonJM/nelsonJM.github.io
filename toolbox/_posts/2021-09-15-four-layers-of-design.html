    <p>The 4 layers:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc">
        <li><strong>Outcome</strong> - What are we trying to achieve?</li>
        <li><strong>System</strong> - What are the boundaries of our solution? What other systems will it interact with? What are the parts?</li>
        <li><strong>Interaction</strong> - How will someone move through our system? How will they accomplish things?</li>
        <li><strong>Visual</strong> - What's the layout, typography, color, style?</li>
    </ul>
