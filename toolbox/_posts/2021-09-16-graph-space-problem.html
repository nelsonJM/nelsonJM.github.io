    <p>We occupy 3D space.</p>

    <p>However, problems can be described by 6 dimensions.</p>

    <p>Just like we can explore the room we're sitting in, we can explore a problem space by answering the questions 'who/what?', 'how many?', 'where?', 'when?', 'how?', and 'why?'.</p>
    <h2>One neat connection</h2>
    <p>Designing interactions is about answering 'how?'. You get there by answering the preceding questions.</p>
