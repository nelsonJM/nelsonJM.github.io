    <p>These are a few of the definitions that I got from Alan Klement. They might be useful when trying to create something "new". I think they are helpful when starting from first principles. They're related to another tool I use called "separating motivation from implementation". </p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>Problem-solving an existing design/environment won't get you to the 3D printer.</p>
    <h2>Environments</h2>
    <p>The outcomes from using Netflix are different than those from using Fortnite, but the environment "help me zone out" is the same.</p>
    <h2>Solutions</h2>
    <p>Focusing on a desired environment and testing solutions and what things do/don't work.</p>
