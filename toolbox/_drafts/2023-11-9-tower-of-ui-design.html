<p>The Tower of UI Design comes from Ryan Singer. It looks like this:</p>    
<ul class="list-disc mb-5">
    <li>Domain: Life experience.</li>
    <li>Situation: What's happening "at 2pm on a Tuesday"?</li>
    <li>Flows: Walkways through the app; chains of affordances</li>
    <li><a href="/toolbox/tools/2021/09/16/affordances/">Affordances</a>: Connect the screens of a given flow. </li>
    <li>2D Layout: The arrangement of elements on a given screen. "How it looks".</li>
</ul>

<h3>Time and Space</h3>
<p>The first 3 from the top (domain, situation, flows) involve the element of time. The last 2 are focused on "space".</p>
