    <p>This goes something like this:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc mb-5">
        <li>Look at an interface, it could be a screen you are designing.</li>
        <li>Look away, then look again.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Which parts of the UI feel like they are pushing into your brain - meaning you don't have to think much, you almost instantaneously "get it"?</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>When I look away and back at this screenshot, I sense the blue highlighted headings are jumping out and into my brain :). It's only after my eyes wander around, that I notice who's the subject of the page.</p>
    <div class="w-1/2">
        <img src="/assets/look-away-look-again-example-1.png"/>
    </div>
