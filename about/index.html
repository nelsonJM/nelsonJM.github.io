 <h1>About Josh</h1>
 <p>I'm currently working full-time as a web designer at Farm Credit Bank of Texas.</p>
<p>My design education began with a focus on graphic design, web & mobile design, and UX design. Supporting these pillars is a foundation in typography, color theory, layout, grid, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        
        <img src="/assets/study-plan.jpg" alt="study plan" />
        
        <p>I continue to build upon these skills with new methods, tools, and approaches.</p>
