		<p>I approach each project with attention to the goals and desired outcomes, typography, color, and layout. Iâ€™m also skilled at writing HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.</p>
		<p>When I'm not hanging with the best family in the world, I'm deep in my go-to playlist of books, podcasts, and videos, working on a new project, or bugging smart people on Twitter with my questions.</p>
