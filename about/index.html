<img src="../assets/meeting-the-horse.jpg" class="mb-5 float-left w-52 mr-5"/>

<p>My design journey began in 2009 as a freelance web designer. Soon I started to ask "what makes a design <em>good</em>?" This led me to UX design and a passion for understanding customer motivation, goals, constraints, and behavior.</p>
<p>I currently live in Concord, North Carolina with the best family in the world. I enjoy rolling around my neighborhood on the skateboard and bugging smart people on Twitter with design-related questions.</p>
