 <h1>About Josh</h1>
 <p>I'm a self-taught designer who enjoys separating motivation from implementation to help people make progress.</p>
<p>Some of my abilities include:</p>
 <ul>
 	
 	<li>UI design</li>
 	<li>Creating high-fidelity mockups in Sketch and Figma</li>
 	<li>Writing UX copy</li>
 	<li>Sketching storyboards and writing stories to guide design efforts</li>
 	<li>Writing basic vanilla JavaScript</li>
 	<li>Troubleshooting in the browser with Chrome DevTools</li>
 	<li>Prototyping in HTML and CSS</li>
 </ul>
 <br/>
<p>These days I'm especially interested in the intersection of design, consumer behavior, markets, and business strategy.</p>
