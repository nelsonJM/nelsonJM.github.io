 <h1>About Josh</h1>
        <p>Wow, what to say. Let's start with a few quick facts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In high school, I used MS Paint to add my headshot to a photo of famous west coast rappers</li>
          <li>In college, someone asked me to design a flyer for a student club...and it was terrible</li>
          <li>My first "real" job was as an administrative assistant, but I was frequently asked to attend website usability meetings because I "probably used websites alot".</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But seriously, my favorite and final fact is related to the crumpled piece of paper in the photo below:</p>

        <img src="/assets/study-plan.jpg" alt="study plan" />

        <p>That's a study plan or path towards the goal of becoming an Interactive Designer. A friend and mentor of mine sketched it out for me in a coffee shop. I knew about Photoshop and had completed a few tutorials, but like many newbies, I had no idea which direction to take. This plan showed me a "way" and kept me busy and focused through the good and bad times.</p>

        <p>Nowadays, I continue to build upon these skills with new methods, tools, and approaches. I use visual communication techniques, words, and affordances to lead users through processes that enable them to get from point A to B.</p>
        <p>In brief, this boils down to understanding their life situation (the domain) and identifying their motivations, constraints, and desired outcomes or states, to design something that balances those forces and improves their situation.</p>
