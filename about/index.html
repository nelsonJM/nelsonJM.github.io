	<p>Think of this site as my workbook. Each project is the application of some topic that's made an impression on me. My areas of interest are design, research, and product strategy. When I'm not hanging with the best family in the world, I'm deep in my go-to playlist of books, podcasts, and videos, working on a new project, or bugging smart people on Twitter with my questions.</p>
