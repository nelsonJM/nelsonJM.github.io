            <p>My name is Josh Nelson. I have held design roles for over 15 years. I began as a freelance web designer, creating custom WordPress themes for small businesses. I later transitioned into the corporate world, working as an in-house web designer, gaining a deeper appreciation for the long-term maintenance of my design work.</p>
            <p>Working in-house exposed me to the internal tools that employees used on a daily basis. Up until then I only worked on marketing websites. "Tools", in the software sense, were just things people used to get things done. Through listening to product design podcasts, I developed an interest "problems" and how designers made choices to "solve" those problems. I began to seek a concrete answer to the question "what makes a design "good"? or "why <em>this design</em> vs <em>that</em>one.</p>
            <p>I dived deeper into usability and customer research. I found an approach that worked for me and ultimately allowed me to move into a UX design role, where I had greater access to research and the opportunity to focus on tools.</p>
            <p>Today, I'm employed as a UX Designer, working on both the company website as well as tools for our employees. Of course, not all ideas can be pursued within the walls of our employers. Sometimes I just want to run with an idea and see what happens. That's why this site exists. This is the home of my personal projects. The current ones are really old, but I love them. I have some ideas cooking. For now, my focus will continue to be on design with a little bit of HTML, CSS, & JS.</p>
