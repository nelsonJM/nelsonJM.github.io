<h1 class="leading-tight mb-5">Welcome</h1>
<p>My name is Josh Nelson. I live and work in NC.</p>
<p>I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Spanish and Business. I planned to move abroad, but days before my flight, I found my future wife and my plans changed (for the best!). Knowing that I needed a job, a friend and designer, introduced me to the world of Web Design.</p>
<p>I began designing websites in 2009. My first clients were a local firewood delivery service and an acupuncturist. I designed both their websites and learned enough PHP and WordPress to build each a custom theme. I loved seeing my static designs become interactive and eventually took a position as a full-time WordPress developer.</p>
<p>Later, as I learned a bit of UX Design, Design theory, and customer research, I landed a UX Designer role for a workers' comp insurance company.</p>
<h2>What I'm up to</h2>
<p>I work at Keysight Technologies where my current role is a mix of design, front-end development, UX Design, and even a little support.</p>

<p>All the best,</p>
<p>JN</p>
