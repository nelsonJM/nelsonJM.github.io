	<p>I'm Josh Nelson. I've worked as a web developer, web designer, and currently as a UX designer. I'm interested in growth design, research, and business strategy.</p>
	<h2>My story</h2>
	<p>I started learning design and development in 2010, after a friend of mine helped me draft the following study plan:</p>

	<p>As you can see, my plan consisted of learning core skills within the broad categories of graphic design, web/mobile design, and UX design - built on top of foundational skills in HTML, CSS, JS, color, layout, grid, and typography.</p>
	<h2>From websites to tools</h2>
	<p>The first couple of years of my design journey was focused on the visuals - addressing questions of style. It was fun, but I wanted to go deeper and try to answer the question 'what makes a design <em>good</em>?'. In my search for answers, I came across the writings of Basecamp designer, Ryan Singer. I discovered Basecamp after listening to an interview with Ryan. According to Ryan, Basecamp (then, 37signals) always felt like making websites wasn’t their strong suit. When work began on Basecamp, they quickly realized they were on to something. That story encouraged me tremendously. I learned that design starts before the 2D/visual layer. Basecamp’s approach to design and business changed my whole paradigm.</p>
	<h2>From quality to JTBD</h2>
	<p>One of the biggest lessons I learned from Basecamp was how to step into the customer's shoes to solve a problem and improve a product. It's a mindset that's especially effective when applied to functional tools (as opposed to marketing websites) that people use to accomplish tasks and solve problems.</p>
	<p>If you're keeping track, my journey so far has been:</p>
	<ul class="list-disc mb-8">
		<li>"Design is aesthetics and style"</li>
		<li>"Design is about solving problems - people use products to close the gap between where they are now and where they want to be"</li>
	</ul>
	<p>But, in addition to the points above, I'm interested in how design can be used to create desirable experiences enabled by products. For this, I've turned to Revealed's Jobs-to-be-Done theory and methods. In particular, I'm learning more about their unique process for predicting consumption.</p>
	<h2>Phew!</h2>
