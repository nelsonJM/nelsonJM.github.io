 <h1>About Josh</h1>

 <h2>I like taking photos of notes</h2>
  <p>Like this one:</p>
        
        <img src="/assets/study-plan.jpg" alt="study plan" />
        <p>It's a study plan with a view to becoming an Interactive Designer. A friend and mentor of mine sketched it out for me a few years ago inside a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.</p>
<p>I was seeking direction in the wilderness of code tutorials and design literature. This plan showed me a "way" and kept me focused when the territory became overwhelming.</p>
        
          

        <p>Nowadays, I continue to build upon these skills with new methods, tools, and approaches.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, my aim is to understand the life situation surrounding the particular design I am creating. This means identifying motivations, desired outcomes and constraints, to design something that balances those forces and improves the situation.</p>
        <h2>Let's compare notes</h2>
        <p>Lately I've been digging into some design and innovation theory and occasionally tweeting about it. If you want to talk about design, innovation, that-thing-you-heard-on-that-podcast, send me an email or reach out on twitter.</p>
