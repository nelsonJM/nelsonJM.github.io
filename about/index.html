        <!-- <p>Hi, I'm Josh Nelson. I live and work in Austin, Texas. I strive to always learn new things, but here are a few favorites:</p> 
      <ul>
<li>        Users are customers
</li><li>Customer experience depends on the domain, human eye-brain system, empathy, and implementation
</li><li>Patterns are definitions of problems, problems are the difference between things as desired vs things as perceived, and perception is biased by the past, present context, and goals.
</li><li>Space-thinking vs time-thinking
</li><li>Try reducing anxiety vs adding features
</li>      </ul> -->
