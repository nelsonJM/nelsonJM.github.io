 <h1>About Josh</h1>
<p>A few years ago, inside a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, a friend and mentor of mine sketched out the chart below. It's a study plan with a view to becoming an Interactive Designer.</p>
        
        <img src="/assets/study-plan.jpg" alt="study plan" />
        
<p>I was seeking direction in the wilderness of code tutorials and design literature. This plan showed me a "way" and kept me focused when the territory became overwhelming.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, I continue to build upon these skills with new methods, tools, and approaches.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, my aim is to understand the life situation surrounding the particular design I am creating. This means identifying motivations, desired outcomes, and constraints, to design something that balances those forces and improves the situation.</p>
