			<p><strong>People come to me for...</strong></p>
		<ul class="list-disc mb-5">
			<li>Graphic Design</li>
			<li>Web/Mobile Design</li>
			<li>UX & Interaction Design</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I do a few more things, but it all rests upon a good foundation of Typography, Color theory, layout, HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.</p>
		<p><strong>Some of my favorite things to do are...</strong> <br/>hanging with the best family in the world, drawing on the iPad, rolling around the neighborhood on the skateboard and bugging smart people on Twitter with design-related questions.</p>
