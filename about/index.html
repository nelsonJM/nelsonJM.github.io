<h1 class="leading-tight mb-5">About this site</h1>
<p>My name is Josh Nelson and this site is dedicated to my personal projects. I've held different roles, but the one I most identify with is "designer". </p>
<p>I began designing websites in 2009. My first clients - a local firewood delivery service and an acupuncturist. I built a custom WordPress theme for each client. It was awesome seeing static designs become interactive.</p>


<p>All the best,</p>
<p>JN</p>
