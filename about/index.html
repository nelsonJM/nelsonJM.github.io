<h1 class="leading-tight mb-5 text-xl">👋🏽 Hi, I'm Josh Nelson. I'm an Interactive Designer.</h1>

<p>I started designing websites in 2009. My first clients were a local firewood delivery service and an acupuncturist. I designed both their websites and learned enough PHP and WordPress to build each a custom theme. That's how I work. If I don't know how to do something, I find someone who does, study, and do my best to do the thing.</p>
<p>I typed this in North Carolina, where I live with the best family in the world.</p>
