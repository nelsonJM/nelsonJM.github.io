<h1 class="leading-tight mb-10 text-xl">👋🏽 Hi, I'm Josh Nelson. I design digital things (apps, websites, etc.).</h1>
<img src="../assets/meeting-the-horse.jpg" class="mb-5 float-left w-52 mr-5"/>
<p>I started designing websites in 2009. My first clients were a local firewood delivery service and an acupuncturist. I designed both their websites and learned enough PHP and WordPress to build each a custom theme. That's how I work. If I don't know how to do something, I find someone who does, study, and do my best to do the thing.</p>
<p>I currently live in Concord, North Carolina with the best family in the world. .</p>
