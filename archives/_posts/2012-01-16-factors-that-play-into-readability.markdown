<p>Here are 5 factors that play into readability on the web (thanks to Matt Cronin's article '10 Principles for Readable Web Typography'):</p>
<p>1. Hierarchy - Defines how to read through content. Shows where to start reading and where to read through. It's the difference in size between headers and body text.</p>
<p>2. Contrast - Are you squinting? Good contrast makes text easy on the eyes, easy to scan quickly and more readable. Stay in the range of black-on-white contrast.</p>
<p>3. Line-height - Leading (line-height) depends on font size and measure. The longer the measure, the greater the leading should be.</p>
<p>4. Letter spacing - The space between each letter in a word.</p>
<p>5. Line length - The number of words per line.</p>
