<p>Photoshop's Pen Tool has the following hidden capabilities:</p>
<p>Convert to Point tool (for curvature modification) - Opt while hovering over an anchor pt (creates tangent line)</p>
<p>Direct Selection tool (white arrow; move anchor pts) - Command</p>
<p>Path Selection Tool (black arrow) *When I used this one, I duplicated the path, so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Needs more investigating. - Command + Opt</p>
<p>Group Selection Tool - Command + Opt while hovering over a path segment or anchor point *Same issue as the Path Selection Tool shortcut.</p>
<p>Add Anchor Point Tool - Hover over path segment</p>
<p>Subtract Anchor Point Tool - Hover over anchor point</p>
