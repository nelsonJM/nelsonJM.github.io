<p>Last month, I went on a trip to New Jersey to attend my wife's cousin's daughter's quinceanera. Before leaving on the trip, I decided to spend 2 nights redesigning the homepage of Protect America. Coincidentally, the birthday girl's dad owns a local home security business. I started the project with a little competitor analysis. Nothing too sophisticated, but good enough to generate some ideas and develop a direction. By the way, if I had to pick a home security company based solely on their website, I'd choose ADT. </p>
<p>I studied 4 of their competitors homepages and judged them on 9 criteria:<br />
1. Is the phone number visible? Are there calls to action?<br />
2. Does the page layout make sense? Are elements aligned properly?<br />
3. Can I find help when I need it? What about tolerance for my errors?<br />
4. Is there a way to search the site?<br />
5. How is the quality of the writing?<br />
6. Does the site instill trust? Are they credible?<br />
7. Are the forms intuitive?<br />
8. Navigation and Information Architecture<br />
9. Overall website functionality</p>
<p>For each competitor I created a simple graph and plotted points representing how well the homepage satisfies my criteria. Below is the graph I produced for ADT's homepage:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.joshmarknelson.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/analysis_ADT.jpg"><img src="http://www.joshmarknelson.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/analysis_ADT-300x225.jpg" alt="analysis_ADT" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-839" /></a></p>
<p>The center of the graph means the homepage doesn't quite hit the mark, the inner circle means 'half way there' and the outer circle means 'good job'. As you can see, I though ADT did a good job on all criteria except 'search'.From there, I went on to sketch out some ideas on plain 'ol paper. I quickly moved from paper to Sketch app (my favorite PS replacement) and began mocking up the homepage.</p>
<p>Protect America frequently changes the design of their homepage (probably analytics testing), so these are the best 'before' pictures I could get:</p>
<p><strong>'Before' #1</strong> - approximation of the homepage design last month, <strong>before</strong> my redesign (courtesy of the Wayback Machine).<br />

<p><strong>'Before' #2</strong> - the current homepage design as of today, 5/2/14<br />

<p><strong>Finally</strong>, here's <strong>my redesigned</strong> homepage:<br />
