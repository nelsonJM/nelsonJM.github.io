<p>I mentioned this tip in the previous Photoshop tip, but I thought it might be easier to locate if it was placed in it's own post. If you want to see only one specific layer and hide all the others, simply Option + click on the layer's eyeball icon and all the other layers will be hidden. Repeat the process to turn the layers back on.</p>
