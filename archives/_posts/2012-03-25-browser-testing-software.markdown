<p>This morning I used <a title="Link to Adobe BrowserLab" href="https://browserlab.adobe.com/en-us/index.html#state=browse">Adobe BrowserLab</a> to view a website that I've been working on. BrowserLab is an online tool for viewing webpages in various browsers for testing purposes. According to Adobe, it generates a screenshot of a webpage in real time and provides diagnostic tools for uncovering cross-browser compatibility issues. I haven't explored the tools included in the service but I did view a webpage in IE6 and got some strange results. You can also view local webpages, but I think that requires Dreamweaver or Firebug. I'll definitely come back to this tool and explore some of the diagnostic tools that are available.</p>
