<p>Here's a button cover (takes the place of a real button) that I made this morning.  The idea comes from the <a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-ebook-photoshop2.html" target="_blank">Mastering Photoshop for Web Design Vol. 2</a> ebook from Smashing Magazine.  <a id="more"></a><a id="more-237"></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/uploads/2011/11/Screen-shot-2011-11-05-at-10.33.31-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-238" title="Screen shot 2011-11-05 at 10.33.31 AM" src="/assets/uploads/2011/11/Screen-shot-2011-11-05-at-10.33.31-AM.png" alt="a button cover UI element" width="558" height="275" /></a></p>

<p>The topic is judging various methods of placing noise and textures on UI elements based upon the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of layers used: using as few layers as possible is the goal</li>
<li>Ability to scale: will the quality of the effect be maintained if the document is resized?</li>
<li>Can the noise be placed on the color and gradient layer styles ?</li>
<li>Can the method be used with any texture, not just noise?</li>
</ul>
<p>The conclusion was that creating a Gradient Fill Layer, adding a Pattern layer style, and then creating a vector mask was the best solution for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>creates flexible, scalable, and editable single-layer UI elements with texture.</li>
<li>gradient fill layers can be dithered</li>
</ul>
<p>While making this I learned how to take screenshots of Layer Style menus in Photoshop (Mac screenshots).</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Layer Styles dialog box with the settings you want to take a screenshot of, for example Stroke.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CMD + SHIFT + 4</strong>.  This will bring up some <strong>crosshairs</strong>.  Press the <strong>spacebar</strong> to switch to a <strong>camera icon</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Hover</strong> the camera over the Layer Style dialog box and <strong>right-click</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will have a screenshot of Layer Style dialog box with all the Stroke settings waiting for you on your Desktop or wherever you have designated screenshots to be saved.</p>
