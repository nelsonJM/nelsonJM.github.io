<p>I found this great game called "<a title="Type Connection" href="http://www.typeconnection.com/index.php">Type Connection</a>" created byÂ Aura Seltzer, a designer who created the game for her MFA thesis project. The 'About This Site' page states that "Type Connection" is a game that helps you learn how to pair typefaces. It has a dating game spin that basically involves deciding on whether or not two typefaces make a good match. You start the game by choosing a typeface (this is likened to the "main character" in the typical dating game show). Next, you review the characteristics of 4 other typefaces and make a decision on which typeface you think might be a good match for the main typeface. I chose Adobe Garamond Pro for my main typeface and discovered that Maple complimented it nicely. There are some nice examples of typeface pairings on the site as well as solid list of typography resources.</p>
