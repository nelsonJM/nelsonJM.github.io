<p>When you have the pen tool selected, you'll see a drop down box next to the Custom Shape Tool button in the pen tool property bar. This is where the Rubber Band option lives. Check the box and now you can see the curve connecting the last anchor point to the mouse's current position. This is helpful when setting anchor points in exact positions is your goal.</p>
