<p>Recently, I attended an <a title="HourSchool" href="http://hourschool.com/">HourSchool</a> class titled 'Sketching As Communication' by Alex Pappas. The class was great and a very helpful introduction to visual note-taking. I took away a few great tips, tricks, and exercises that I've been trying to practice every day. Here are three that come to mind:</p>
<p>1. If you can draw a cube, pyramid, and sphere, you can draw pretty much anything. I've since made drawing these objects part of my daily routine.</p>
<p>2. Instead of drawing stick figures, draw box figures. This means use boxes to represent the torso rather than a line. Also, practice contorting the box/torso in the many ways that people normally move to give your box figures expression and personality.</p>
<p>3. Practice. The only way to get better at drawing is to draw. Devote a little time each day to drawing these 3 things: something that exists in front of you, something that exists from memory, or something that does not yet exist.</p>
<p>*Bonus - Visual note-taking can help you re-tell a story. The next time someone is telling a story in a meeting, start drawing the events, facts, whatever, that are being told. Focus on the major points and don't worry if your rendering of a cow doesn't look like a cow; what matters is that it looks like a cow to you.</p>
<p>This is the second HourSchool class that I have attended. The first was 'Adaptive Images in Responsive Web Design' by Christopher Schmitt. Both were awesome, informative, and very affordable.</p>
<p>As a special treat, I've scanned a copy of some sketches I created this morning. Go draw something!</p>
