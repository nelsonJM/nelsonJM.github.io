<p>I'm taking a Skillshare class called "<a href="http://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/Illustrate-Your-Day-An-Intro-to-Symbol-Design/2090276120">Illustrate Your Day: An Intro to Symbol Design</a>" by The Noun Project. I signed up several months ago, but only recently started watching course videos and completing exercises. The goal of the class is all in the title: Illustrate Your Day. How? By picking 20 of my daily activities (called referents) and designing a symbol for each one. </p>
<p>User comprehension is one of most important aspects of symbol design. Symbols should effectively communicate their intended message back to the user.</p>
<p>The course focuses on two techniques for designing symbols: narrative and iconic. Narrative symbols are relatively more detailed in order to convey a story. They usually depict people who are engaged in an activity. The iconic technique focuses on the basic facts of the concept they're representing. For example, an iconic symbol might use an eye to represent a trip to the eye doctor, while a narrative symbol might depict an eye doctor shining light into a patient's eye. </p>
<p>Both the iconic and narrative techniques attempt to strengthen user comprehension.</p>
<p>Design style is also an important aspect of symbol design. The styles mentioned in the course are outline and filled. They probably don't need much explanation, but I will say that designing symbols with the 'filled' style requires a bit more skill than designing with the 'outline' style. </p>
<p>The course relies on Illustrator, but I'm going to try using Sketch app. Below are my referents as represented with pen and paper. I'll post their Sketch app versions soon.</p>
