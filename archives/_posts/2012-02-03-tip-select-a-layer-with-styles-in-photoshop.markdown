<p>I learned this tip from one of Jeffrey Way's videos on slicing a PSD. After a quick search on the web, I found out that it is a shortcut for 'Copy Merged' under the Edit tab in Photoshop. This is useful when you are slicing a PSD and you want to select something in the design that has effects applied to it. First you select the element (using the black arrow tool, CMD + click thumbnail), then you press Shift + CMD + C to copy the element along with its effects. From there, you can open a new Photoshop document and paste your element along with its effects. I found that if I first turn off all the other layers (Opt + click the layer containing the element that I want to select), then select and Shift + CMD + C, I avoid copying elements from other layers.</p>
