<p>I haven't posted in a while so I thought I'd give a quick update as to what I've been doing with myself. Recently, I completed Luke Wroblewski's Mobile First, whoo hoo! I'm also working my way through Luke's Web Form Design: Filling in the Blanks. Both books are awesome and enlightening. I hope to start a new project soon and I have been reading up on pricing strategies and creating questions for initial meetings with clients. When I have a few minutes, I also work on my JavaScript course exercises over at codecademy.com. I'm slowly making progress and I'm currently learning about recursion.</p>
<p>Well, I know this post is kind of scattered, but hopefully it will let you know that I'm still working.</p>
