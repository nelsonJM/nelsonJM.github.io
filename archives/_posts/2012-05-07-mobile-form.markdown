<p>My last post was about using the Unicode triangle character as part of a suggestion bubble (I think I called it a 'tool-tip'). Well, that bubble was part of a <a title="Email domain autocomplete form." href="http://tutsplus.com/tutorial/building-a-mobile-friendly-form-with-email-domain-suggestion/">mobile form tut</a> that I was working on and recently completed. Check out the <a title="Autocomplete mobile form" href="http://www.joshmarknelson.com/examples/mobile-form/">final product</a>.</p>
