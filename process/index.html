<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-5">My Process</h1>
<p>The language and structure is heavily inspired by and largely taken verbatim from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lj6RGYRCDpiNis2mYsScfWfwyPWjd4LXUy-4bKJEuts/edit" target="_blank">Intercom's design process</a>. After working on cross-functional teams in large organizations, I've found so many overlaps between the two processes, that I figured Intercom "says it best".</p>

	<h2>Understand the problem</h2>
    <p>Understand and articulate the problem we're trying to solve. Ensure we've asked enough questions and challenged assumptions.</p>

    <h3>Determine what type of process we need: complex, exploration-based or lightweight, intuition-based</h3>
    <p>I studied Intercom's design process framework - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrbJRZAu4hU&t=892s" target="_blank">presented by Alex Potrivaev</a> - and decided to create an artifact that I could use for future projects as a reference.</p>

<h2>Concept & Pick a solution</h2>
        <p>Ideate ways to solve the problem in lowest possible fidelity. Gain sufficient confidence to decide on which direction to go.</p>
    
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>Work with the team to figure what's the smallest coherent solution of the concept that can be shipped and tested if it has solved the problem.</p>

<h2>Detailed design</h2>
<p>Figure out the necessary flow and interaction design details to enable engineers to start building the scoped solution.</p>

<h2>Build</h2>
<p>Work with engineers to finalize design, resolve edge cases, polish, QA and ship a solution.</p>
