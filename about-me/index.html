 <div class="about-me">
 	
        <p>I am a UX &amp; Interaction designer living in Austin, Texas. I enjoy helping people make progress with design that fits their real-life situation.</p>
    
  <p>My design journey began when a friend advised me to learn UX design, front-end development, graphic design and mobile-first design. He helped me put together a study plan for tackling these areas of design and more.</p>
