    <h1>Hello,</h1>
            <p>I'm <strong>Josh Nelson</strong>. I'm a designer living in Austin, Texas. I enjoy helping customers make progress with design that fits their real-life situation.</p>
      
<h2>Brief Origin Story</h2>
  <p>My design journey began when a friend advised me to learn UX design, front-end development, graphic design and mobile-first design. He helped me put together a study plan for tackling these areas of design and more.</p>

  <p>I learned quickly and soon took on freelance work, designing and building websites like <a href="http://austinfirewood.com/">www.austinfirewood.com</a> and <a href="http://aacmclinic.com/">www.aacmclinic.com</a>.
  <h2>Using Design to Help People Make Progress</h2>
  <p>I am at my best when solving real problems experienced by real people with real intentions. This was the motivation for designing <a href="../projects/counter-app/">Counting Eye</a>. Understanding the customer's viewpoint and how they make progress from one life situation to another and designing something that will do it better is extremely rewarding.</p>
