  <h1 class="page-heading">About Me</h1>
  
<p>In 2009, I began learning how to use Photoshop through a series of courses on Lynda.com. I learned HTML and CSS through Smashing Magazine articles, Tuts+ videos, the Barnes and Noble tech books section, and even library books.</p>

<p>These days Iâ€™m focusing on product design and specifically UI design.
