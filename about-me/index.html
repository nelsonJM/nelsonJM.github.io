    <h1>Brief Origin Story</h1>
  <p>My design journey began when a friend advised me to learn UX design, front-end development, graphic design and mobile-first design. He helped me put together a study plan for tackling these areas of design and more.</p>

  <h2>"Design is..."</h2>
  <p>What is design? Here's a list of responses I would've given throughout my career:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Code, Style &amp; Typography</li>
    <li>Interaction Design</li>
    <li>Gestalt &amp; User Experience Design - the 'How?'</li>
    <li>Separating Motivation from Implementation or Helping People Make Progress - the 'Why?'</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each response reflects my interest at a given point in time. I am and I expect to continue cycling through these themes throughout my career.</p>
