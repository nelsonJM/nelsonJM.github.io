<h2>Notes on the Synthesis of Form' by Christopher Alexander</h2>
<p>I found out about this book after watching a talk, Designing with Forces, given by Ryan Singer[1]. It's a way[2] of solving complex design problems by identifying and resolving the "forces" that bear on the thing you are designing.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p><em>"These notes are about the process of design: the process of inventing physical things which display new physical order, organization, form, in response to function."</em></p>
<p><em>"although ideally a form should reflect all the known facts relevant to its design, in fact the average designer scans whatever information he happens on, consults a consultant now and then when faced by extra-special difficulties and introduces this randomly selected info into forms otherwise dreamt up in the artist's studio of his mind. The technical difficulties of grasping all the info needed for the construction of such a form are out of hand - and well beyond the fingers of a single individual."</em></p>
<p><em>"these notes describe a way of representing design problems which does make them easier to solve. It is a way of reducing the gap b/t the designer's small capacity and the great size of his task"</em></p>

<p>1. Ryan Singer gave a talk called "Designing with Forces" (watch it at <a href="http://feltpresence.com/" >http://feltpresence.com/</a> - scroll to bottom of page) which was based on Christopher Alexander's 'Notes on the Sythesis of Form'. That talk is awesome and in my opinion a must-watch for interface designers.</p>
