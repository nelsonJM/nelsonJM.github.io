<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This is a time-tracking app that I designed some time ago. I have two main reasons for posting here:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I want to share the <a href="https://twitter.com/rjs/status/734870570945368064">the messy story</a> I went through (as best as I can recall) to get to this point.</li>
		<li>I'm interested in exploring the design, in particular the "adding time" functionality.</li>
	</ul> 
	<p>Whether or not I'll try to build the whole thing is still unclear.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Design Process</h3>
<h4>Main Capabilities</h4>
	<p>The following are capabilities the app will offer:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Add time to a project for "today" and any given day.</li>
		<li>See how much time I spent on a project.</li>
		<li>See how much time my team has spent on a project.</li>
		<li>See how I spent my time this month.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>After identifying the capabilities, I did the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Wrote down words and concepts from the domain. Examples are: team and project.</li>
		<li>Sketched user flows. I began with "How do I add time to a project?".</li>
		<li>Sketched screens/views</li>
	</ul>
