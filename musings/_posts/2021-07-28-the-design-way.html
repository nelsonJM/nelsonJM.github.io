<p>"...design will always be about creating something that does not yet exist".</p>
<p>"Design is about service on behalf of the other"<p>
<h2>In my words</h2>
<p>Regarding the first quote: Science describes "what is" or "the true" whereas design creates what "should be", making it a matter of will and intention.</p>
<p>Regarding the second quote: as designers, we're not forcing our will upon others or merely helping clients create what they already know they want. Ideally, we're co-designing with clients to produce the <strong>"expected unexpected"</strong>, i.e. something that the client could not have imagined and realized on their own, yet resonates with their desire.</p>
