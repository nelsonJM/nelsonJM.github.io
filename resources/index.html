<h1>Resources</h1>
<p> A collection of ideas and resources that I've found helpful along my journey as a designer.</p>

Nelson and Erik Stolterman</a></h3>
	
	
	

	<p>"...design will always be about creating something that does not yet exist". Science describes "what is" or "the true" whereas design creates what "should be", making it a matter of will and intention.</p>

<p>"Design is about service on behalf of the other"
Also from 'The Design Way', this is the idea as designers, we're not forcing our will upon others or merely helping clients create what they already know they want. Ideally, we're co-designing with clients to produce the "expected unexpected", i.e. something that the client could not have imagined and realized on their own, yet resonates with their desire.</p>

	<h3>3. Russell Ackoff</h3>
<p>Systems thinking ideas have caused me to see my designs as systems that interact with other systems. One of the early steps in designing a system is to decide how that system should interact with other systems. From there, you can determine the parts of the system and how they relate to each other and the whole.</p>

<h2 class="mb-4">Space-thinking vs. Time-thinking</h2>

		Ryan Singer, Laracon 2016</a></h3>

<p>Space-thinking is the process of determining how elements should be arranged on a given screen. Time-thinking steps out of the individual screen and asks "what happened before this screen?" and "what will they see after this screen?". It's very helpful for determining which affordances should be on a given screen to make the flow work.</p></div>

	<h3>5. Designing with Forces
	How to Apply Christopher Alexander in Everyday Work
	Ryan Singer</h3>
<p>This talk helped me understand patterns as a family of forces. Understand the forces impinging on your design helps you choose or create the pattern that will resolve those forces. The "forms" we create, like the sanddunes rippled by wind, reflect the various forces that they are under.</p>

by Kevin Mullet and Darrell Sano</a></h3>
<p>Mullet and Sano's book is a secret weapon, packed with design techniques for those who lack a formal education in visual communication design. The brief section on "visual variables" helped me understand some of Edward Tufte's 'Visual Display of Quantitative Information'.</p>

by Steve Schoger and Adam Wathan</h3>
<p>Steve Schoger has been kicking out hot design tips together with developer Adam Wathan. A common, but powerful principle runs through Steve's video: Decide to make a change, make the change, determine what, if anything, improved or worsened because of the change, and make another change.</p></div>
