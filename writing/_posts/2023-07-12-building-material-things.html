<h2>A quote about craft</h2>
<p>"In all object making, that aspect which relates to its conceptual interpretation is art, that which relates the object to an intended purpose is design, and the quality of its execution is craft."</p>
<p>The quality of its execution is craft. Three things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Quality</li>
    <li>Execution</li>
    <li>Craft</li>
</ul>
